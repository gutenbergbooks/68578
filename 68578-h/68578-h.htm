<p class="noi"><span class="sidenote">Strangeness of Polish
history.</span><span class="smcap">The</span> Kingdom or Republic of Poland has always
seemed a strange phenomenon in European history, partly from
the aboriginal character of its population, and partly from its
exceptional constitution. The ancient Sarmatians, who occupied
the same territory, had no share in the old Roman civilisation,
but rather, by their constant irruptions upon the empire,
were mainly instrumental in its downfall. Christianity was
introduced in the tenth century; but, until recent times, no
other civilising force has ever effected a permanent conquest
of the country. <span class="sidenote">Aboriginal character of
the Poles,</span>During the eight following centuries the Poles,
surrounded by enemies—on the north and east by more barbarous
tribes, on the south and west by a superior civilisation—were
exclusively confined to the defensive and so missed those
humanising influences to which a conquering nation has so often
had to submit. As late as the eighteenth century they might
truly be called the lineal descendants in race, in character,
and almost in habits, of the hunters and shepherds of the
ancient North. <span class="sidenote">Seen in their social
system.</span>Throughout their history there were two great
classes in the State; the so-called noble class—the heirs of the
savage in their desire for equality, and of the nomad in their
love of freedom—and the peasant class—the descendants of captives
taken in war—whose lives and properties were at the absolute
disposal of their masters. Only in the western portion of the
kingdom was there a burgher class, and this was on the same<a
id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
political footing with the serfs. The union of two great evils
arising from such a system—licence and servitude—made the
Polish constitution as disastrous as it was unique. Poland thus
differed so widely, both socially and politically, from every
other European state, that it would be impossible to examine any
important period of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]
</span> history without explaining alike her position in
Europe and some of her internal peculiarities.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">European position of
Poland,</span>Although considerably<a id="FNanchor_2"
href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> larger than France,
Poland took scarcely any part in the general history of Europe
before the end of the sixteenth century. Once only, just before
the taking of Constantinople, we find her with Hungary striving
to check the advance of the Turks, when she lost in battle her
king Wladislas VI. (1444). <span class="sidenote">At first
inconsiderable,</span>As she was the north-eastern outpost of the
Church, the Popes took care that she should always be remarkable
for her submission to the Holy See. But it was beyond their
power to check the turbulence of the nobles or to instil any
love for a higher civilisation. During the sixteenth century,
chiefly through the enterprise of foreigners, commerce made rapid
advances in the country. English and Italian merchants, favoured
by treaties between the king and queen Elizabeth, settled in
the prosperous town of Dantzic, and spread a moderate knowledge
of Poland in western countries. That this knowledge was only
moderate may be judged from a valuable geographical work<a
id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
published in London early in the seventeenth century, in which we
are told that the Lithuanians still worshipped idols, and that
in another province they had not learned the use of the plough.
The reformed doctrines were widely disseminated before the year
1600; but their progress was checked by the activity of the
Jesuits. <span class="sidenote">Owing to exclusiveness,</span>The
Papal Nuncio of that time<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4"
class="fnanchor">[4]</a> complains of the exclusiveness of the
Poles and their distrust of foreign nations. They used commonly
to boast that alliances were of no service to them, for, if
the country were conquered, they could, like their ancestors,
recover in winter what they had lost in summer. Yet very early
in their history they had lost the rich province of Prussia<a
id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> by
neglect and mis-government. When, in 1573, they allied themselves
with France by electing as their king Henry of Valois, they bound
him by such a crowd of onerous restrictions that he fled the
country in disgust at their wild and barbarous freedom. <span
class="sidenote">Anarchy,</span>During the next three quarters
of a century (1573-1648), under three princes of conspicuous
ability, Poland began to rank among the second-rate powers of
Europe; but her internal condition was all the while frightful.
Unceasing struggles between the greater<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_5">[5]</span> and lesser nobility, and the cruel
oppression of the peasants by both alike, distracted the kingdom.
<span class="sidenote">And foreign wars,</span>Then followed
thirty years of desolating war, in which the country was several
times on the brink of final subjugation by a foreign invader.
The Poles themselves attributed their survival to God alone<a
id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>, who
had preserved them to form a barrier against the Turks.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Then suddenly most prominent,</span>At
the close of this period, instead of finding Poland exhausted
almost to death, we see her occupying the proud position
of the saviour of Europe. At a most critical moment, when
the last great wave of barbarian invasion was rolling over
Europe, and seemed likely to overwhelm the ancient empire of
the Hapsburgs, this little republic stood firmly in the gap,
and became the bulwark of Christendom against the infidel.
Nay more, by her own sacrifices no less than by her opportune
intervention, she was the main instrument in setting the final
limit to the Ottoman advance. <span class="sidenote">Owing
to John Sobieski.</span>This extraordinary result is to be
ascribed almost solely to the personal character and exploits
of her patriot king, John Sobieski. Rising to the throne by
his personal merits alone in spite of the most malignant envy,
he was the first native king unconnected with the old royal
line. <span class="sidenote">His difficulties mainly caused by
the constitution.</span>It may be said that his life from his
early manhood is at no time the history of a private man; it
rather comprises the whole contemporary annals of his country.
Yet it forms the most destructive comment on her institutions,
both social and political, and on the character of the national
nobility. While we must admire a conservative constitution which
admits of the supremacy of the best man, we cannot but deplore
those faults in its working which had the effect of nullifying
his authority. In Poland there was neither a republic nor a
monarchy, but the sovereignty of one man under the control of an
unrestrained class, which mistook licence for freedom. In order
to understand the position of Sobieski and the difficulties
with which he had to contend, a short account of the Polish
constitution is indispensable.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Monarchy generally becomes
elective.</span>The authority of the king was originally
absolute, but in a nation of fierce warriors he was easily
controlled by armed assemblies of his subjects. His consulting
them, though at first only a mark of favour, was soon looked
upon as a right; and in course of time they even claimed the
disposal of his dignity. Two great dynasties successively
reigned in Poland. During the first, founded by Piast, a native
Pole (850-1386), the dignity was hereditary; during the second,
that of Jagellon (1386-1573), though in practice<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span> hereditary, it
was in theory elective. <span class="sidenote">Election of the
king.</span>After the latter period the whole nobility met in
arms to elect a king, and, though a relation of the old line was
preferred, he was considered to have no claim. This assembling
of the Pospolite, as it was called, was in an emergency the
prerogative of the king, and during an interregnum of the
Primate, the Archbishop of Guesna, who acted as interrex. The
election was not legal unless it was unanimous; and when this
was accomplished, seldom without violence, the republic imposed
upon the new monarch a contract styled “pacta conventa,” the
conditions of which he swore faithfully to observe. <span
class="sidenote">His privileges.</span>His privileges were
few. He always presided in the national assembly, and he might
if he chose command<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7"
class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the army. But his most important
function was the appointment of officers of state. These are
said to have amounted in all branches to the astounding number
of 20,000; <span class="sidenote">The Senate.</span>but only the
most important, about 140, composed the Senate, which was the
middle estate of the realm and the real executive.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">How composed.</span>Besides the bishops
there were three great orders in the administration, of which
only the first two had seats in the Senate. These were the
palatines, the castellans, and starosts. Each palatine, like
a Norman baron, was the military commander and supreme judge
in his province or palatinate; he was also its recognised
political head. The castellans were his deputies, who discharged
the same functions in a more confined area. The starosts were
inferior magistrates, with military and judicial duties, whose
chief privilege was the high value of their benefices. <span
class="sidenote">The officers of state.</span>There were
twelve great dignitaries who were entrusted with the higher
executive,—six for the kingdom of Poland, viz., the Grand
Marshal, the Grand General,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8"
class="fnanchor">[8]</a> the Second General, the Chancellor,
the Vice-Chancellor, and the Grand Treasurer, and six parallel
officers for the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The latter, when
incorporated with Poland in 1386, had insisted on a distinct
administration; but the arrangement proved most unfortunate,
for the Polish magnate had no authority over his Lithuanian
compeer. In the army, as in the administration, they might act
quite independently of each other, and the very equality made a
collision inevitable. Over the Senate as a whole the king had no
real power, but the Diet exercised a rigid supervision.</p>

<p>This body—the third estate of the realm—had originally been
composed of the whole adult nobility. So jealous were the Poles
of their privileges that it was not till<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_7">[7]</span> 1466—two hundred years after the
foundation of the House of Commons—that they consented to form a
representative system. <span class="sidenote">The Diet.</span>A
Diet of 400 deputies met every two years, and was liable to
be summoned on extraordinary occasions. The members of this
assembly were absolutely without discretionary powers. They
were elected in the dietines or provincial assemblies, and
received minute instructions as to their course of action. After
the dissolution of the Diet they had to appear again before
their constituents and give an account of their stewardship.
Those who had offended found their lives in peril. <span
class="sidenote">Its dependence upon the nobility.</span>Thus
the Diet took its stamp from the prevailing temper of the
nobility, and, as this was almost always quarrelsome, the place
of meeting often resounded with the clang of sabres. <span
class="sidenote">Results of this dependence.</span>During
the period which we shall have to consider, this dependence
will explain the constant neglect of proper means for the
national defence. The cavalry of the nobles—the flower of the
troops—displayed all the disadvantages, and none of the merits,
of a standing army. They were always under arms, and ready to use
them in any feud; but they could not brook strict discipline,
and as they grew more luxurious their disinclination<a
id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> to a
long campaign was duly reflected in the ranks of the Diet. The
national haughtiness found its vent in intestine strife. <span
class="sidenote">The veto.</span>A most disastrous provision made
it necessary for every resolution of the Diet to be unanimous.
Any deputy might, without reason assigned, pronounce his veto
upon the subject under discussion; nay, more, by a refinement
of this privilege,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10"
class="fnanchor">[10]</a> he might by withdrawing declare the
Diet dissolved, and until he was induced or compelled to return
public business was suspended. This power, though very ancient,
was not exercised till 1652, but was afterwards repeated with
increasing frequency. It would once have been dangerous for
an individual to defy the mass, but when the republic was in
a state of anarchy it was easy to find supporters, and the
gold of France or Austria often proved a powerful incentive.
<span class="sidenote">Obstruction.</span>Another mode of
obstruction was called drawing out the Diet, which could not<a
id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
sit for more than six weeks. This consisted in the proposal
and tedious discussion of irrelevant matter, until the day of
dissolution arrived. In this state of things a resort to force
was very common, and the public streets were often the scenes of
a sanguinary fray.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Confederations.</span>When the
Diet was not sitting, the Senate, with the king as its
president, was responsible for the government. But if the
nobles were dissatisfied with their measures, or if the veto
had hopelessly clogged the wheels of state, recourse was had
to an extraordinary assembly called a “confederation.” <span
class="sidenote">Convocations.</span>This<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_8">[8]</span> was formed sometimes to resist,
sometimes to enforce the established law; and in the latter
case it often took the shape of a “convocation,” which exactly
resembled the Diet except that the veto was inadmissible.
The Poles were always more happy in organising anarchy than
in organising their institutions. Of course, the authority of
a confederation depended upon the number and weight of its
adherents; and it frequently happened that several of these
bodies were sitting at the same time. We sometimes find in Polish
history the Senate at variance with the Diet, the Diet with the
king, the king with the grandees, the greater with the lesser
nobles, and the whole nobility with their armed serfs. <span
class="sidenote">Strife among the nobles—how caused.</span>Among
the nobles religious inequality was the principal cause of
dissension. Although none but Catholics could hold offices of
state, a large number of the poorer nobles were “Dissidents,”
and belonged to the Greek or Protestant persuasion. <span
class="sidenote">Their three main classes.</span>They were
thus naturally jealous of the official families; for, though
all were theoretically equal, the differences of wealth and
prestige tended to divide them into three classes: first, a few
princely families who owned whole provinces and aspired to the
posts of the supreme executive; secondly, the average gentry,
who scrambled for the lesser offices, or were indignant at
their religious disabilities; and thirdly, the poorer freemen,
who made up for their lack of power by a spirit of captious
disaffection. In stormy times the confusion was increased by half
the middle gentry taking part with the grandees and half with the
freemen.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Ancestry of John Sobieski.</span>From
the highest of these classes was sprung John Sobieski. He
belonged to that group of families, whose ancestral device was
the Buckler—the most illustrious of the rude Polish coats of
arms. Far back in the mist of ages are placed the exploits of
Janik—the Polish Hercules—the founder of his house. His immediate
ancestors had gained less doubtful laurels. His grandfather,
Mark Sobieski, palatine of Lublin, had so great a military
reputation that King Stephen Bathori (1575-1586) was wont to
say that he would not fear to entrust to his single arm the
defence of the fortunes of Poland. His father, James Sobieski,
was not only an able general, but a man of cultivated mind, and
of some diplomatic skill. To him belonged the real credit of the
famous victory of Kotzim in 1621 over a vast host of Turks and
Tartars, although the nominal commander of the Poles was the
young Prince Wladislas, son of Sigismund III. His success in
negotiating the treaty that followed was so conspicuous that he
was afterwards sent on several foreign embassies to the Western
Powers. Such eminence in peace as in war doubtless procured
for him the post of castellan of Cracow<a id="FNanchor_12"
href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>—the first
secular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
senator of Poland, inferior only to the archbishop of Guesna. He
had also been four times elected Marshal of the Diet—an office
resembling that of Speaker of the House of Commons. In or about
1620 he married Theophila Danilowiczowna, grand-daughter<a
id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> of
the famous Zolkiewski. That heroic general, after taking Moscow
(1610), and carrying off to Poland the Czar Basil VI., met his
death (October 5th, 1620) at Kobylta on the Dniester, with a
band of 8,000 men, at the hands of 70,000<a id="FNanchor_14"
href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Turks and Tartars.
Thus on both sides the ancestors of Sobieski were worthy of
his subsequent fame. <span class="sidenote">Birth.</span>The
circumstances of his birth are romantic; but they rest on no
less an authority than a manuscript in his own hand. On the
17th of June, 1624,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15"
class="fnanchor">[15]</a> his father’s castle of Zloçkow in the
palatinate of Red Russia<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16"
class="fnanchor">[16]</a> was visited by a storm of unprecedented
violence. The old mansion, which stood exposed on the bare
summit of a vast “mohila” or Slavonic tumulus, was shaken to its
foundations, and some of the attendants were rendered deaf for
life. Amid the raging of the elements was born John Sobieski, in
the presence of the widow of the conqueror of Moscow; and the
respect for prodigies,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17"
class="fnanchor">[17]</a> which distinguishes the Poles above
all other modern nations, must have marked him out in their
eyes for an exceptional career. Yet his youth was singularly
peaceful. Except for the war against Gustavus Adolphus, which
was terminated by the peace of Altmark (September 15th, 1629),
and an incursion of the Tartars (1636), successfully repelled
by Wladislas VII., Poland enjoyed from the time of his birth an
unexampled respite of more than twenty years.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Education.</span>During this period
John and his elder brother Mark were enjoying all the benefits of
a careful education. Their father chiefly resided at his princely
estate of Zolkiew, which had come to him through his wife—a
domain as large as some of our English counties, and embracing
a hundred and fifty villages. He had engaged as their tutor
the learned Stanislas Orchowski; but he himself superintended
their more important studies. The treatise which he has left
upon education is alone enough to show how well the task must
have been performed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]
</span> Besides instructing them in several languages he
imparted to them his own skill in music, painting, and the other
fine arts; and they had the rare advantage of a home in which
to the barbaric splendour of a Polish noble were added some of
the refined tastes of an Italian court. Ardent and robust by
nature, John early distinguished himself by his activity in
hunting, and in the use of the small sword; and the traditions of
his family soon taught him against whom his strength was to be
employed. The inscription<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18"
class="fnanchor">[18]</a> on his great grandfather’s tomb in the
neighbouring Dominican chapel, erected by his mother, aroused
in his mind what may be called his life-purpose—to curb at all
hazards the advance of the Turkish power.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">His travels.</span>At length
in 1643 the castellan sent his two sons to travel in the
West. Their longest stay was made in France—at that time
closely united to Poland by the marriage of Wladislas with
a French princess<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19"
class="fnanchor">[19]</a>—but they also visited England<a
id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
and Italy. At Paris they frequented the salon of the Duchesse de
Longueville, sister of the great Condé; and it was here that an
intimacy sprang up between John Sobieski and the French general,
who, though only three years his senior, was already crowned with
the laurels of Rocroi. The prince procured for his friend the
honour of a commission in the king’s Grands Mousquetaires, and
continued in correspondence with him during the remainder of his
life. Quitting France before the disturbances of the Fronde, the
brothers took the measure of the Ottoman power at Constantinople,
and were preparing to pass into Asia, when news arrived which
called them home to defend not only their country but their
own fireside. It was to the effect that the Cossack serfs had
revolted, and were carrying all before them.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cossack revolt caused by the oppression of
the serfs.</span>Of the grinding oppression under which the
serf class laboured we have already spoken. Some efforts had been
made by Casimir the Great (1347) to give them a legal footing
in the state; and he had even succeeded so far as to provide
that the murderer of a serf should pay a fine of ten marks.<a
id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
But his regulations were soon broken, and the condition of the
peasants in the outlying districts became more hopeless than
before. <span class="sidenote">The Cossacks.</span>The situation
of the Cossacks was peculiar. Inhabiting a wild though fertile
country on the borders of Poland and Muscovy called the Ukraine
(Slavonic for “borderland,” exactly the French “marche”),
they had long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
retained their independence, and had only been incorporated in
the kingdom by the wise measures of Stephen Bathori (1582).
<span class="sidenote">Under Stephen Bathori.</span> Originally
deserters from the armies of the republic, they had betaken
themselves to the almost inaccessible isles of the Borysthenes,
where they led a life of plunder in defiance of their
neighbours. Their piratical skiffs were an object of terror

even to the dwellers on the Golden Horn. Bathori did all that
lay in his power to conciliate a people who, in spite of their
savage habits, were noted for their fidelity. He gave them the
city of Tretchimirow in Kiowia, and formed them into regiments,
for the defence of Poland against the Tartars. They were granted
the power of electing their own hetman, or Grand General, who, on
doing homage to the king, received as the symbols of his office a
flag, a horsetail, a staff, and a looking-glass. James Sobieski
in his historical work<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22"
class="fnanchor">[22]</a> notices the value to a retreating
Polish army of their waggon-camps, which they called “Tabors,”<a
id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
and which they seem to have drawn up after the fashion of a
Dutch “laager.” Unfortunately their independence was confined to
the period of military service. The Ukraine, like other parts
of the kingdom of Poland, was divided into estates of crown
land, which, like fiefs,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24"
class="fnanchor">[24]</a> were held by the nobles on condition of
furnishing the state with troops. But this condition was seldom
fulfilled even in Great Poland, and never in a distant province,
such as the Ukraine, where all the nobles were absentees.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Their grievances.</span>There was thus
no tie except that of gratitude for their honourable position
in war to bind the Cossacks to Poland; and this was soon broken
by the outrageous rapacity of the Jewish stewards to whom the
nobles entrusted their lands. Complaints were lodged in the Diet
by the Cossack chiefs, who claimed to send thither their own
representatives; but the nobles, whose love of domination was as
strong as their love of liberty, turned a deaf ear; and Wladislas
VII., seeing the fatal tendency of this policy, had the hardihood
to remind the Cossacks that they still possessed their sabres.<a
id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
<span class="sidenote">Success of their revolt.</span>At length,
in 1648, a dastardly outrage by a steward on Bogdan Chmielniçki,
one of their chiefs, forced them to follow this hint; and
electing the injured man as their hetman, they poured into Poland
with the Tartars as their allies. Bogdan was an experienced
soldier. He completely defeated Potoçki, the Grand General of
Poland, at Korsun (May 26th, 1648); and numbers of disaffected
Poles—Arian nobles, Calvinistic burghers,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_12">[12]</span> outlawed serfs—at once flocked
to his standard. <span class="sidenote">Death of Wladislas
VII.</span>Six days before this disaster Wladislas VII. expired
at Warsaw; and his death at this moment blighted the hopes of
the moderate party. James Sobieski, who had done all he could to
save Bogdan from oppression, had died in March (1648) when the
king was on the point of naming him the representative of Poland
at the congress in Westphalia. <span class="sidenote">Danger
of Poland.</span>The nobility in general were bent on revenge.
Assembling their forces in haste, they suffered an ignominious
defeat at Pilawiecz (September 23rd); and Poland was left exposed
to the Cossacks. Madame Sobieska, with her two daughters, and
many others of the nobility, took refuge within the walls of
Zamosç, and was soon joined by her sons, who had evaded without
difficulty the undisciplined besiegers.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Election of John Casimir.</span>At
this crisis the nobles assembled at Warsaw to elect a king. They
chose (November 20th) Cardinal John Casimir, brother of the
late king, who put off the purple to assume the crown. The new
prince saw the necessity of conciliation, and had the courage,
in spite of the opposition of the nobles, to open a negotiation
with the rebels. Bogdan, who had been deserted by the Tartars,
was not disinclined for peace, and, in order to show his
respect for the king, retired thirty leagues from Zamosç. <span
class="sidenote">His peace violated by the nobles.</span>But
the treachery of the nobles frustrated the intentions of their
sovereign. Jeremiah Wiesnowiesçki, the harsh oppressor of the
serfs, fell suddenly upon the unsuspecting Cossacks, and routed
them with great slaughter. After this the war broke out afresh.
Bogdan sought and obtained the alliance of Isla, khan of the
Crim Tartars, and in an engagement at Zbaraz, in Volhynia
(June 30th, 1649) he gained another great victory. <span
class="sidenote">Sobieski joins the army,</span>At this news the
king hastened to join the remnants of the defeated army, and
was accompanied by John Sobieski in command of a select troop.
The young noble had been prevented taking part in the events
of the past six months by a wound which he had received in a
duel with one of the family of Paz, the most powerful clan in
Lithuania; and he afterwards had cause to regret the quarrel.
His presence with the king at this juncture was destined to
be of some importance. No sooner had Casimir assembled the
discomfited Poles, than half his available force, terrified at
the enemy’s numbers, insisted on retreat, and proceeded to put
their threat into execution. <span class="sidenote">And quells a
mutiny.</span>Sobieski galloped into their midst, and, exerting
that native eloquence of which he possessed no common share,
succeeded in restoring them to their allegiance. His efforts were
rewarded by the starosty of Javarow—a military post which had
been previously held by his father and by the great Zolkiewski.
<span class="sidenote">Peace of Zborow.</span>One of the
immediate results of the bold front now presented by the Poles,
was the conclusion of the peace of Zborow (August 18th),<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span> in which the
Cossack chief displayed remarkable moderation. He consented to do
homage to the king and to forego his just demands for vengeance
upon his oppressors, on condition that all his adherents should
receive a free pardon.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Broken by the Poles. June 30th,
1651.</span>But the Polish nobility were incapable of learning
any lesson from their recent reverses. War was again declared
by the Diet in 1650; and the next year Bogdan was defeated by
Casimir at Berestezko, owing principally to the desertion of the
Tartars. In this battle, John Sobieski received a wound in his
head, from the effects of which he suffered constantly until
his death. A transitory peace which followed this success was
again broken by the Poles, who attacked Bogdan’s son Timothy at
Batowitz (June 2nd, 1652), but were surrounded and annihilated.
<span class="sidenote">Death of Mark Sobieski.</span>The
prisoners, among whom was Mark Sobieski,<a id="FNanchor_26"
href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> were all massacred
after the battle by the Tartar khan. Another duel wound
fortunately prevented John from being among the victims. But he
had the pain of seeing that his folly had made his mother despair
of the name of Sobieski. Overwhelmed with grief at the loss of
her favourite son, and auguring ill from the headstrong passions
of John, she quitted Poland and took refuge in Italy.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Lessons of the Cossack War.</span>The
Cossack war, which had now lasted with little intermission for
four years, demands considerable attention. It throws a lurid
light on the vices of the Polish constitution, and its bitter
lessons cannot have been lost upon a thoughtful mind like that of
John Sobieski. By oppression the Polish nobility had converted
faithful subjects into deadly foes; and their pride and treachery
contrast most unfavourably with the moderation of the Cossack
chief. Although we have little information about this period of
Sobieski’s life, his ardent temper makes it probable that he
joined at first with the most uncompromising of the nobles. But
their independence of the regal authority, their disregard for
treaties with the serf class, and, above all, their unprecedented
employment of the fatal veto (1652), must have soon convinced him
that the discipline of self-restraint was the only means left to
save his country. Hereafter we shall see him nobly practising
this lesson under the most fearful provocation.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Anarchy.</span>At this period (1654)
Poland was distracted by anarchy at home, and in the next
six years she suffered all the usual consequences of civil
strife. Henceforward the Cossack war loses its character of a
struggle between the republic and her rebellious subjects. <span
class="sidenote">The Cossacks call in Muscovy.</span>Its natural
result was to draw into the contest those neighbouring nations
who might hope to gain advantage from<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_14">[14]</span> the distracted state of Poland.
Bogdan, despairing of concluding any definitive peace without
foreign aid, persuaded the Czar Alexis to declare war against
Poland, and, on the frivolous pretext that his titles had not
received due respect, that monarch invaded Lithuania and took
Smolensko (Sept. 10th, 1654).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">War with Sweden.</span>But a greater
enemy was arising in the north; Charles X. of Sweden, the
“Pyrrhus of the North,” succeeding to the throne on the
abdication of Christina in June 1654, had set his mind on the
conquest of Poland. The Polish vice-chancellor, Radzejowski, who
had been expelled from the kingdom by Casimir on some private
quarrel, took care that Charles should be well acquainted with
the weakness to which his country had been reduced. He gave the
welcome advice that no apology which Casimir might make as to
his assumption of the title of king of Sweden<a id="FNanchor_27"
href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> should receive
any attention. The king of Poland was anxious to send Sobieski
to Stockholm to avert the impending storm; but he declined the
hopeless mission. Charles eagerly took advantage of the anarchy
caused by the Russian war, and invaded Pomerania and Great Poland
in August, 1655. He gained an easy victory over the divided
forces of the republic, and entered Warsaw at the end of the
month. Cracow surrendered early in October, and, as Casimir had
fled into Silesia, the whole country lay at his feet. <span
class="sidenote">Charles X. conquers Poland,</span>Surrounded
by such a host of enemies, the nobles seemed to have no choice
but to offer the crown to Charles X.; and the standing army,
called Quartians,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28"
class="fnanchor">[28]</a> among whom Sobieski commanded a troop,
took the oath to the king of Sweden. <span class="sidenote">But
alienates it.</span>But Charles was not inclined to keep
faith with a people whom he had conquered in three months.
Contrary to his express promises hereditary monarchy was
proclaimed, heavy contributions were levied, and the Catholics
were openly persecuted by the Swedes. The national spirit was
deeply wounded by the haughty demeanour of the conquerors.
<span class="sidenote">Resumption of the war.</span>During
the absence of Charles in Prussia, a confederation was formed
in the palatinate of Beltz under the auspices of the absent
Casimir, to which Sobieski attached himself, and with him the
able generals Lubomirski and Czarnieçki. When Charles returned
he found that he had the greater part of Poland to re-conquer.
<span class="sidenote">Successes of Sobieski.</span>In conveying
his army through the marshes of Little Poland, he was blocked up
between the Vistula and the San by Sobieski’s cavalry, and was
only extricated by the prompt arrival of reinforcements. Soon
after, while he was superintending the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_15">[15]</span> siege of Dantzic, Casimir and
the valiant Czarnieçki recaptured Warsaw; but they lost it
again on his return after a battle of three days, in which
Sobieski, who commanded a troop of Tartars<a id="FNanchor_29"
href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> trained by himself,
performed prodigies of valour. But other nations had looked on
with jealousy at the brilliant career of the king of Sweden. The
Czar, resenting the manner in which he had been baulked of his
prey, declared war against Sweden; and the emperor Ferdinand
III., just before his death (May 30th, 1657), concluded an
offensive and defensive alliance with the king of Poland. <span
class="sidenote">Charles attempts a partition,</span>Meanwhile
Charles was using all his efforts to carry out a scheme for
the partition of Poland between himself, the Czar, the Great
Elector of Brandenburg,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30"
class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and Ragoczy, prince of Transylvania.
But her time had not yet come. Almost at the same moment
Denmark declared war against Charles, the Elector deserted
him, and Austria prepared to send troops in support of her new
ally (June, 1657). <span class="sidenote">But is obliged to
retire.</span>In July Charles evacuated Poland in all haste, and
began his wonderful campaigns in Denmark. Another stroke of good
fortune was the death of Bogdan Chmielniçki (August 27th), and
the return of a large number of Cossacks to their allegiance.
<span class="sidenote">Gradual recovery of Poland,</span>Though
sorely shaken by the terrible ordeal through which she had
passed, Poland gradually recovered her independence. Treaties
were concluded with the Elector, and with Prince Ragoczy, with no
more serious loss than the suzerainty of ducal Prussia (1658);
and two years later, shortly after the death of Charles X., a
peace was signed with Sweden at Oliva (May 3rd, 1660). <span
class="sidenote">Sobieski rewarded.</span>Casimir re-established
his authority throughout the kingdom; and in distributing rewards
to his most faithful subjects, conferred upon Sobieski the post
of Korongy, or standard-bearer of the crown.<a id="FNanchor_31"
href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">War with Muscovy.</span>There still
remained, however, the war with Muscovy. The ever-active
Czar Alexis, now that he could take his own measures with
Poland, overran Lithuania, and captured Wilna, its capital.
But his general, Sheremetieff, suffered a serious defeat,
and shut himself up in his fortified camp at Cudnow to await
the arrival of a large reinforcement of Cossacks. <span
class="sidenote">Victories of Sobieski at Slobodyszcza and
Cudnow.</span>Sobieski was detached with a small force from
the investing army to confront this new enemy. Finding them
encamped on the heights of Slobodyszcza, he carried the position
by assault, and gained a victory so complete that the Cossacks
laid down their arms (Sept. 17th, 1660). He then hastened
back to Cudnow, and joined in the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_16">[16]</span> attack on the Muscovite camp,
which was so successful that the whole army, with their
ammunition and stores, fell into the hands of the Poles. Such a
brilliant campaign astonished Europe. Sobieski, whose reputation
was already high in his own country, was justly credited with
giving her breathing time to recover from her misfortunes.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Anarchy in Poland.</span>She
employed it, according to her wont, in internal dissensions.
It is difficult to trace the true origin of the deplorable
state of Poland during the next six years; but it may be
attributed, in the first instance, to the foolish conduct
of the queen, Louise de Nevers. Though a woman of masculine
spirit, and exercising a great ascendancy over the uxorious
Casimir, she was herself entirely governed by the Jesuits.
<span class="sidenote">1661.</span>They persuaded her, and
through her the king, to violate that article of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pacta
conventa</i> by which he pledged himself not to tamper with
the succession to the crown. The person for whom they designed
it was her nephew, the young Duc d’Enghien, son of the great
Condé. <span class="sidenote">1662-3.</span>The power of
French gold soon converted the majority of the senate. But the
lesser nobles were not so easily cajoled, and they possessed a
secret though powerful supporter in Lubomirski, Grand Marshal
and Second General of the crown. To this main grievance was
added another, which pressed heavily on the poorer nobles.
Large arrears of pay were, as usual,<a id="FNanchor_32"
href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> owing to the
army, who accordingly formed themselves into a confederation,
and demanded the diminution of the immense revenues of the
clergy. This brought upon them all the thunders of the Church;
and the fearful spectacle was presented of a country divided
into hostile camps, in which the senate was at enmity with the
diet, the clergy with the army, the larger with the lesser
nobility. Sobieski and other patriotic spirits tried to strike
at the root of the evil, and furnished funds from their private
resources for the payment of arrears. As this did not allay
the complaints of the army, the senate opened a negotiation
with the malcontents from Sobieski’s “court”<a id="FNanchor_33"
href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> at Zolkiew, which
was so far successful that the king was able to lead them against
Muscovy.<span class="sidenote">Campaign against Muscovy.</span>
But the campaign, though not disastrous, was not especially
fortunate; and the absence of Lubomirski, who had been kept at
home by the king’s suspicions, created general discontent.</p>

<p>On his return the king summoned Lubomirski to trial on a
charge of high treason. He did not appear, and was condemned to
perpetual banishment and the loss of his honours and estates.
<span class="sidenote">Sobieski, Grand Marshal and Second
General.</span>His office of Grand Marshal was bestowed on
Sobieski, and that of Second General on Czarnieçki; but the
latter dying shortly after, this post<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_17">[17]</span> was also conferred on Sobieski.
The appointments were most politic, for Sobieski was a great
favourite with the army. His duties having kept him constantly on
the Cossack frontier, he had not compromised himself with either
party.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Marriage of Sobieski.</span>These signs
of the royal favour were followed by another which bound him
still more to the interests of the court. On his visit to Warsaw
to assume the insignia of his offices, he became enamoured of a
French lady in the retinue of the queen, Mary Casimira d’Arquien,
who had lately become a widow by the death of the rich Prince
Zamoyski. <span class="sidenote">His wife.</span>She was daughter
to the Marquis d’Arquien; captain of the guards to the Duke of
Orleans, and had attended the queen from France nineteen years
before. Though over thirty years of age, she still possessed
in a remarkable degree all those fascinations which usually
belong to extreme youth. Dr. South, who saw her seven years
later, says that even then she did not look more than twenty.<a
id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
To these advantages she united a piquant vivacity which had
a peculiar charm for Sobieski. His passion was so strong<a
id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
that he besought the queen’s consent to their immediate union.
Scarcely four weeks had elapsed since the death of Zamoyski,
to whom she had borne several children; but so necessary was
it to conciliate the new officer that the queen gave way, and
the marriage was celebrated, according to the Polish fashion,
by a festival of three days.<span class="sidenote">July 5-7,
1665.</span> Sobieski was hereafter to receive severe punishment
for this indecent haste in the conduct of his wife. <span
class="sidenote">Rebellion of Lubomirski.</span>In the midst of
the marriage <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fêtes</i> tidings arrived
that Lubomirski, who had entered Poland with a large army, was
ungenerously plundering his estate at Zolkiew, and carrying off
his stud of horses. The proscribed general, who was a prince of
the empire, had received secret support from Leopold of Austria,
and was now in open rebellion.</p>

<p>The whole kingdom was divided against itself. The
palatinates of the west, gained over by Austria, resented
the predominance of France at court, and joined Lubomirski.
<span class="sidenote">Sobieski tries arbitration.</span>An
effort was made by Sobieski to get the decision of the Diet on
Lubomirski’s claims, but the assembly was dissolved by the fatal
veto, and the two armies advanced to the struggle. Contrary
to the earnest advice of Sobieski, Casimir made his attack
in the marshes of Montwy (July 11th, 1666), and his troops,
entangled in the difficult ground, were easily defeated. <span
class="sidenote">Peace with Lubomirski.</span>But Lubomirski
was anxious to come to terms, and, having extracted a promise
from Casimir that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]
</span> would not interfere in the succession, he waived his
personal claims, and retired to Silesia, where he died six months
after.</p>

<p>His faction, however, was not silenced. Bands of hungry
soldiers, clamouring for pay, levied black-mail upon the
provinces; and the central authority seemed powerless to restrain
them. <span class="sidenote">Invasion of the Tartars.</span>At
this juncture news arrived that 80,000 Tartars were plundering
Volhynia, and that the Cossacks under Doroscensko were preparing
to join them. The utmost consternation prevailed at Warsaw; a
peace was hastily patched up with Muscovy, and efforts were made
to raise fresh troops. But the treasury was empty; the republic
had only 10,000 men under arms; and many of these were most
imperfectly equipped. Casimir applied vainly for help at the
principal European courts; Brandenburg alone sent a few companies
of infantry. At this crisis Potoçki, the aged Grand General,
died, and the king at once appointed the Grand Marshal to the
post.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sobieski Grand General,</span>Never
before had any Polish subject united in his own person these two
offices. As Grand General Sobieski had absolute control over
military affairs, and could quarter his army where he pleased;
<span class="sidenote">As well as Grand Marshal.</span>as Grand
Marshal he was at the head of the administration, received
foreign ambassadors, and could inflict death without appeal.
In most points, as in the last, his power was really greater
than that of the king; for although the king could confer these
honours, he could not revoke them. No higher testimony could
have been paid to the prudence and ability of Sobieski than
the readiness with which these unusual powers were granted,
and the very transitory murmurs that they provoked amongst an
exceptionally jealous nobility. His rise, though fortunate at
its close, had not been so rapid as to be out of proportion to
his merits. The gravity of the crisis doubtless operated in his
favour; and he took pains at once to relieve all suspicion by his
temperate and vigorous action. His persuasive eloquence silenced
the clamours for pay, and he hesitated not to drain his private
coffers in raising new levies. <span class="sidenote">His bold
plan of the campaign.</span>By this means he doubled his original
forces, and then prepared to execute a grand plan for the
destruction of the Tartars. Throwing his army into the fortified
camp of Podhaic, a small town in Red Russia, he detached several
large bodies of cavalry to act in the vicinity. These had orders
on a given day, when the enemy had worn himself out by the
assault, to close round the vast host and help their general
to assume the offensive. To divide so small a force seemed
hazardous in the extreme,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36"
class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and the soldiers murmured openly
that their lives were to be thrown away. The cool courage of
Sobieski made them blush for shame. “He gave all cowards liberty
to depart; as for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]
</span> himself, he was determined to remain with all
those who loved their country.” <span class="sidenote">Sept.
28th-Oct. 15th, 1667.</span>The enemy appeared; and for
seventeen days in succession this heroic band withstood their
most determined assaults. Finally Sobieski, whose troops had
suffered far less loss than they inflicted, gave the signal to
his outlying parties, and attacked the Tartars in front and
rear. <span class="sidenote">Great victory of Podhaic.</span>The
battle was hotly contested; but at length victory declared for
the Poles. Galga, the Tartar khan, found his troops so severely
handled that he was forced to sue for peace, and concluded an
alliance with the republic. Doroscensko, on the part of the
Cossacks, agreed to restore to the nobles their estates in the
Ukraine.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Gratitude of Poland.</span>Poland had
been saved almost by a miracle; and multitudes flocked to the
churches to return thanks to God. When the danger was at its
height, so inert and feeble was the body-politic that Casimir
had found it impossible to arm the Pospolite for the relief
of their devoted general. Their gratitude was now the greater
that their sacrifices had been few. When Sobieski on his return
detailed in modest language the success of the campaign, and
ascribed his victory to the mercy of God, the Diet rose with one
accord and answered that the republic knew who had saved her,
and would remember to thank him. <span class="sidenote">Birth of
a son.</span>The tidings reached his wife, who was staying with
her relatives in France, just after she had borne him a son; and
such was the general admiration that Louis XIV. and Henrietta
Maria, the mother of Charles II., were willing to answer for the
child at the font. He was named James Louis, in honour of his
grandfather and his illustrious sponsor.</p>

<p>No successes against the invader could allay the internal
broils of Poland. Although Casimir had lost his queen in the
spring of the year 1667, the outcry against the French influence
continued unabated. On one occasion the king so far forgot
himself as to exclaim, in full diet, “If you are weary of me,
I am no less weary of you.” <span class="sidenote">Abdication
of John Casimir.</span>At length, bowed down by domestic
sorrow, tormented by scruples of conscience,<a id="FNanchor_37"
href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and disgusted at
the turbulence of the nobles, he came to the resolution, which
those words seemed to imply, of laying aside the crown. He
took farewell of the Diet in a dignified speech, in which he
asked only for six feet of earth, where his bones might rest in
peace. If he had offended any, he begged them to forgive him as
freely as he forgave those who had offended him. The assembly
was profoundly affected; but, although Sobieski and others from
motives of gratitude besought him to retain the crown, it does
not appear that this was the wish of the nation. We are told
that on the day after his abdication the people hardly paid him
the respect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
due to a gentleman;<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38"
class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and much ill-feeling was shown
in the Diet, when the question of his pension came before
it. After remaining in Poland too long for his own credit<a
id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
he retired to France, where Louis XIV. gave him the Abbey of
St. Germain. He was the last of the dynasty of Jagellon,<a
id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
which had reigned in Poland nearly three hundred years.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Candidates for the throne.</span>The
number of aspirants to the vacant throne was, as usual,
considerable. The Czar Alexis massed 80,000 troops on the
frontier in support of the candidature of his son, but the Poles
took little notice either of him or his manœuvres. The Prince
of Condé was supported by Sobieski and many of the Senate, but
the prejudice against a Frenchman was universal among the lesser
nobles. The two candidates most in favour were Prince Charles
of Lorraine, secretly supported by Austria, and Philip, Duke of
Neuberg, who, though sixty years of age, was set up as the real
choice alike of the King of France and the Emperor. The personal
advantages of the former were far superior to those of his
rival; he was young, courageous, and affable; but he had neither
money nor lands, while the offers of the Duke of Neuberg were
most advantageous to the state. <span class="sidenote">Disorder
on the field of election.</span>The nobles, fully alive to the
value of their votes, postponed their decision till May, 1669;
and meanwhile the field of election was as usual a scene of wild
confusion. A large party clamoured for the exclusion of the
Prince of Condé, and, although Sobieski protested against such
a measure as interfering with the freedom of the proceedings,
it was carried through by the violence of its promoters. At
length the tumult rose to such a height that Sobieski, as
Grand Marshal, threatened to fire upon the rioters. Order was
thus partly restored; and soon the cry of a Piast! a Piast!
was heard among the crowd. Sobieski might well suppose that no
Piast (or native Pole) would be thought so worthy as himself to
wear the crown, but perhaps he had made himself too unpopular
during the election. The cry was followed by the proposal of
Michael Wiesnowiesçki—a young noble barely thirty years of age,
who had neither virtues, nor abilities, nor riches to recommend
him to their suffrages. <span class="sidenote">Proclamation of
King Michael.</span>Yet such was the fickle excitability of the
assembly that he was chosen by acclamation; and, although he
implored to be spared the honour, and even attempted to escape,
he was dragged to the throne, and invested with the supreme
authority.</p>

<p>The reign of such a king could scarcely be prosperous. Ere
long the nobles had cause to regret that they had not chosen the
man who of all native Poles was worthiest to hold the sceptre.
Michael himself, when mounted upon the throne, could not but<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span> see that he was far
from being the first man in the republic. The thought wounded his
pride, which was soon to become as conspicuous as his previous
humility. <span class="sidenote">His hatred of Sobieski,</span>He
hated Sobieski with a hatred the more violent that he was unable
to abridge his powers. He refused the grand coach-and-six
which it was the established custom for the general to present
to the new sovereign.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41"
class="fnanchor">[41]</a> He plotted with Christopher and Michael
Paz, respectively chancellor and grand general of Lithuania,
against the man with whom they had a long-standing family feud.<a
id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
<span class="sidenote">Who was popular with the army.</span>But
Sobieski, besides having the army at his back, was zealously
supported by the greater nobles, and although a struggle appeared
imminent the king’s party forbore for a time. Efforts were made
to promote a reconciliation by marrying Michael to the daughter
of Sobieski’s sister;<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43"
class="fnanchor">[43]</a> but the plan was overthrown by the
arrival of an ambassador from Leopold to offer him the hand of
the Arch-Duchess Eleanor. <span class="sidenote">Marriage of
Michael.</span>The honour was too tempting for the weak-minded
king; he accepted from the emperor the order of the Golden
Fleece, and hastily concluded the marriage without the sanction
of the republic. Loud were the complaints against this breach
of the constitution,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44"
class="fnanchor">[44]</a> even among his own supporters, the
lesser nobles. Austria had always been distrusted by the
Poles, but at this moment there was a special reason for her
unpopularity.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Siege of Candia. Designs of Ahmed
Köprili.</span>On the 2nd of September, 1669, after a most
memorable defence of more than twenty years, the city and island
of Candia surrendered to the Turkish fleet, commanded by the
Grand Vizier, Ahmed Köprili. The vast designs of this able
minister were the terror of Europe. Five years earlier (1664)
he had concluded with Austria a twenty years’ peace, on terms
most favourable to the Turks; and it was well known that he
only awaited the fall of Candia to resume his schemes against
Italy and the empire. That result was now achieved, a peace was
concluded with Venice, and he was free to turn the Ottoman arms
towards the west and north.<span class="sidenote">Terror in
Europe at</span> The Marquis de St. André,<a id="FNanchor_45"
href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> who had commanded
in Candia, wrote into France that Köprili had opened the way to
Rome, and by what he knew of that general’s humour, he doubted
not but he had a design to turn St. Peter’s church into the
Grand Signor’s stables. <span class="sidenote">The rise of
Turkey.</span>It is even said that Pope Clement IX. died of
grief at the Turkish successes. These fears were doubtless in
part well founded. During the Thirty Years’ War, and the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span> intestine
struggles which succeeded it in many of the Christian states,
the Turkish power had steadily increased. Two Grand Viziers of
consummate ability, Mahommed Köprili and his son Ahmed, had
strengthened the empire by numerous fortresses, had sternly
quelled the frequent revolts, and had introduced a spirit of
order and activity hitherto seldom seen among the Turks. If the
jealousies of France and Austria were to continue, a wise vizier
might well hope ere long to make a tremendous onslaught upon
Christendom. It is not surprising therefore that, after the fall
of Candia, the Poles should resent the Emperor’s crafty aim to
secure their taking up arms in his defence.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Revolt of the Cossacks.</span>But the
danger was nearer than they imagined. It threatened them as
usual from the quarter of the Cossacks, who had never since
their first revolt in 1648 preserved a real peace with Poland.
They viewed with dismay the accession to the throne of a son of
their former oppressor, Jeremiah Wiesnowiesçki, and imagining
that his first object would be to recover his lost estates, they
rushed to arms. <span class="sidenote">Sobieski’s campaign of
1670.</span>Immediately after the coronation of Michael (October,
1669) Sobieski was called to the frontiers. Acting with his
usual vigour, he sowed discord in the enemy’s ranks, and drove
them beyond the Dniester. So unexpected were these victories
that the Vice-Chancellor, writing to him in the king’s name,
says: “Envy itself is compelled to confess that, after God, you
alone, though at the head of so small a force, have once more
saved Poland.” <span class="sidenote">Michael refuses a policy
of concession.</span>But the king and his general could not
agree as to the measures to be taken with the subdued Cossacks.
Sobieski was most anxious for a policy of concession. He had seen
signs among them of a disposition to call in the Turks, which
they had attempted to do in 1651, and he hoped to avert such a
disaster. But Michael was wholly deaf to argument. Finding that
the Diet was likely to declare against him, he easily procured
its dissolution by the veto (April 17th); and the event which
Sobieski dreaded came to pass. <span class="sidenote">The
Cossacks apply to the Porte.</span>Doroscensko, the Cossack
chief, losing all hope of justice from Poland, and persuaded by
his metropolitan that he would find it at the patriarchate of the
East, went to Constantinople to throw himself at the feet of the
Sultan.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Köprili prepares for war with
Poland.</span>Fortune seemed to play into the hands of
Ahmed Köprili. The restless janissaries needed employment, and
he preferred a gradual advance upon Austria to a premature
declaration of war with her. Poland seemed to offer a splendid
field. Proclaiming the Sultan the champion of the oppressed, he
prepared a great armament against the oppressor, and created
Doroscensko hospodar of the Ukraine. But his plans required time
to be fully matured, and in the meanwhile he encouraged the
Tartars to burst into Poland (1671).</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>

<p><span class="sidenote">Austrian influence in Poland.</span>The
republic was at this moment torn in pieces by the violence of
the Austrian and French factions. Leopold had followed up his
success in the marriage of his sister by surrounding the weak
Michael with creatures of his own, who used all their arts to
persuade him that the French monarch had been guilty of bringing
in the Tartars against him. Great efforts were made to include
Sobieski in these accusations. His second general, Demetrius
Wiesnowiesçki, the king’s cousin, who had long been jealous
of him, actually put Tartar captives to the torture to obtain
evidence, but without success. Sobieski, though deeply indignant,
contented himself with publishing a scornful manifesto, and
then hastened to defend the frontiers. At the meeting of the
Diet (September 20th) the deputies demanded the dismissal of
the Austrian courtiers; and the primate Prazmowski vehemently
accused the king of treachery to the nation, and of breaking his
coronation oaths. <span class="sidenote">Michael calls out the
Pospolite.</span>Terrified at this attack, Michael called out
the Pospolite, which was devoted to his interests; but he paid
no attention to the entreaties of Sobieski that he would use
it against the invader. He could not bring himself to save his
kingdom at the expense of strengthening his rival.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">“Miraculous campaign” of
Sobieski.</span>Sobieski determined to act without him.
Equipping the regular army at his own cost, he appeared to be
covering Kaminiec, the key of south-eastern Poland, but when
the Tartar hordes had passed into Volhynia, he marched with
surprising celerity through Podolia, and cut them off from their
allies, the Cossacks. Trembling for their retreat the barbarians
broke up their camp, and hurried out of the country as fast as
they could, while Sobieski made a triumphant progress through the
Ukraine, capturing several towns which had not seen a Polish army
for twenty years, and re-establishing communications with the
friendly Moldavians. Europe justly termed this “the miraculous
campaign;” yet it was accomplished almost solely by the strenuous
exertions of the commander. His troops were in the worst possible
condition, the Lithuanian army had disbanded without joining him,
and the jealousies of the different palatinates had prevented
their sending him any succours. He now begged for reinforcements
to enable him to dictate peace to the Tartars, and to fortify
Poland against the Turks; but the infatuated malice of the king
made it difficult for him even to keep together the troops under
his orders. <span class="sidenote">December, 1671. He falls
sick.</span>At this juncture fatigue, and perhaps chagrin at the
treatment which he received, laid Sobieski on the bed of sickness
at Zolkiew; and the king redoubled his efforts to separate him
from the army. The attempt recoiled upon his own head. That body
at once moved their winter quarters to the Palatinate of Russia,
and formed themselves into a confederation to protect their
beloved general.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Sultan declares war against
Poland.</span>But the king’s attention was soon most
unpleasantly diverted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]
</span> elsewhere. In the same month (December) an envoy
from the Porte arrived at Warsaw, and announcing that the
Cossacks had been taken under the protection of the Sublime
Porte, demanded reparation for the injuries which they had
suffered. No resource was left to the king’s party but to treat
this as a mere blind intended to conceal from Austria the Turkish
advance on the side of Hungary.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Confederation against the
king.</span>The patience of the great nobles was now
completely exhausted. Under the leadership of Prazmowski they
entered into a confederation to dethrone the king. The advice of
the primate was that they should take the emperor and the Polish
queen into their counsels, and provide some candidate who would
be ready to accept the queen’s hand. Eleanor was consulted, and
professed herself devoted to the plan, if they would choose
Charles of Lorraine, to whom she was deeply attached. <span
class="sidenote">Joined by Sobieski.</span>Sobieski, now
convalescent, was at length made acquainted with these projects.
He strongly opposed any scheme which would place the country
under the espionage of Austria; but being firmly convinced of
the necessity of a revolution, he exhorted them to choose the
brave Duke of Longueville, nephew of Condé. Prazmowski, nothing
daunted, sent the queen the duke’s portrait, and was assured of
her acquiescence. Everything seemed favourable for the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup
d’état</i>; the Diet went out in a body to meet Sobieski; and
the rejoicings at his recovery were universal, when suddenly
news arrived that the Duke of Longueville had been slain at the
passage of the Rhine (June 12th, 1672). The party of the king,
and the Lithuanians, who had trembled at the coming storm, took
fresh courage, while the confederates were proportionately
disconcerted. Michael began to negotiate for Austrian troops to
employ against the Grand General; <span class="sidenote">Invasion
of the Sultan.</span>but in the midst of the confusion it was
announced that Mahomet IV. in person, with the Grand Vizier
and 200,000 men, was advancing upon Kaminiec. The king’s party
loudly averred that this was a fabrication of their opponents;
the Lithuanians swore to defend him to the death; <span
class="sidenote">Sobieski proscribed.</span>and Sobieski, with
others of the leading nobles, was proscribed. This violence
raised a similar storm in the Polish army in Russia, who
surrounded their general, and swore to follow him to the end of
the earth. “I accept your oaths,” was his answer, “and the first
thing I require of you is to save Poland.”</p>

<p>Yet Poland seemed lost beyond all hope. Sobieski’s troops
scarcely amounted to 30,000 men, and there was now no chance
of uniting them to the Pospolite. <span class="sidenote">The
Sultan takes Kaminiec,</span>The Grand General flew to Kaminiec
to reinforce and provision the garrison; but he was obliged to
leave it to its fate, for the governor, who belonged to the
king’s party, refused to admit any of his force. Kaminiec was the
only great fortress which Poland possessed.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_25">[25]</span> Its natural position—defended on one
side by the river Smotrycz, and on the other by an inaccessible
cliff—was very strong; and the Poles constantly boasted that God,
who built it, would alone be able to take it. Yet so skilful were
the Turkish miners, after their long experience in Candia, that
it surrendered within a month.</p>

<p>The consternation at Warsaw was fearful. The king assembled
the Pospolite at Golemba, near the capital; but his one aim
was to conclude peace on any terms. <span class="sidenote">And
advances on Leopol.</span>The Sultan, sending on an advanced
guard to besiege Leopol, the capital of Russia, encamped at
Buczacz, where amongst the Podolian mountains he enjoyed his
favourite pastime of hunting. Meanwhile Sobieski had not been
idle. A large body of Tartars had passed into Volhynia in support
of the Turks, and, after loading themselves with spoil and with
a vast train of captives, prepared to beat a retreat. Hovering
always on their rear, Sobieski struck a blow whenever it was
practicable, and finally caught them in a defile at Kalusz,
in the Carpathian mountains. <span class="sidenote">Victory
of Sobieski over the Tartars.</span>After a great carnage he
dispersed them, recovered the spoil, and liberated nearly
30,000 Polish captives. <span class="sidenote">His attack upon
the Sultan’s camp.</span>He then formed the daring plan of a
night attack on Mahomet’s camp. By swift and silent marches
he approached unperceived, and burst with his cavalry on the
imperial tents. For a moment the quarters of the Sultanas were in
imminent danger; but the arrival of succours put an end to the
raid.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Peace of Buczacz.</span>With his small
force Sobieski could do no more than harass the Turkish army, yet
it was with indignation that he heard that the king had concluded
a peace at Buczacz (October 18th). Michael concealed the terms as
long as he could; and this increased the suspicions of the Grand
General that they were dishonourable to the country. At length it
was found that Podolia, the Ukraine, and Kaminiec had been ceded
to the Porte, and that the king had consented to pay an annual
tribute of 22,000 ducats. In return for this the Vizier withdrew
his army from Polish soil; but he established a vast military
camp with 80,000 men at Kotzim, on the Dniester, to overawe the
vanquished nation. By this treaty, which he had no power to make
without the sanction of the republic, the king of Poland reduced
himself to the condition of a vassal of the Sultan.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Hostility of the Pospolite to
Sobieski.</span>Yet the leaders of the Pospolite at Golemba,
who dreaded nothing so much as a long campaign, were loud in
his defence. Suspecting that Sobieski would not accept the
peace, they renewed against him the sentence of proscription,
and confiscated his estates. On receiving intelligence of these
attacks, Louis XIV. offered him a French dukedom and a marshal’s
bâton; but Sobieski would not forsake his country. Indeed his
position did not justify it; for his party grew stronger day by
day, while the Pospolite, ill-furnished with provisions, and rent
in pieces by faction, gradually melted away. At length the queen
took on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
herself the part of a mediator, and she was seconded by the
Lithuanians, who were weary of anarchy. It then appeared how
strong a hold Sobieski had upon the affections of the people.
<span class="sidenote">Popularity of Sobieski.</span>When his
exploits during the war became generally known there was an
immense reaction in his favour. <span class="sidenote">Plot
against him.</span>His personal enemies, among whom may be
reckoned the king, viewed this with the utmost uneasiness, and
a few of them concocted an atrocious plot against him. They
suborned a poor noble, named Lodzinski, to come forward in the
Diet and declare that Sobieski had sold Kaminiec to the Turks
for 1,200,000 florins, and that this money had been seen in
waggons on the way to its destination. This calumny raised the
Diet to the highest pitch of excitement, and they would have put
the slanderer in irons but for the intervention of the king.
The army declared that they would wash out the insult with
blood; but Sobieski calmed them, and proceeded to Warsaw to
demand a trial. He was welcomed with acclamations; the palace
of Wiasdow, decorated with all the trophies of Zolkiewski, was
placed at his disposal; and Michael sent the Grand Chamberlain
to pay him his compliments. <span class="sidenote">Discovered
and punished.</span>Lodzinski, when brought before a tribunal
of senators and deputies, lost all courage, and confessed that
he had invented the story for the sum of 1,000 francs—promised
him by certain of the nobles. He was condemned to death; but the
sentence could not be carried out without the consent of the
Grand Marshal, and he was therefore suffered to live. The nobles
who had been his instigators had to ask pardon on their knees.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">He persuades the Diet not to accept the
peace.</span>The first object of Sobieski in this sudden
blaze of his popularity was to procure the rupture of the peace
of Buczacz. He at once published a memorandum, setting forth
necessary reforms in the administration and the army, and
promising that their adoption would ensure a successful struggle
against the Turks. The Diet sent him a message in high-flown
Polish rhetoric, in which they begged for the presence of that
hero “who, if the system of Pythagoras be true, seems to unite
in his own frame the souls of all the great captains and good
citizens of the past.” He took his seat amid great enthusiasm
(March 14th), and easily persuaded the deputies to follow his
advice. They did not now dream of paying the tribute. They
decreed an army of 60,000 men, the establishment of a war-tax,
and the despatch of embassies for foreign aid, and finally placed
in the hands of Sobieski full powers both for peace and war.
This was in effect to put aside the king, and make the Grand
Marshal Regent; but no voice was raised against the proposal.
<span class="sidenote">Their confidence in him.</span>Since there
was only a trifling sum remaining in the exchequer, Sobieski
persuaded the Diet to use the treasure stored up as a reserve
in the castle of Cracow. This, with an opportune subsidy which
arrived from the Pope, was deposited<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_27">[27]</span> with him instead of the Grand
Treasurer, as the person most likely to use them to advantage.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">His difficulties.</span>Such unbounded
confidence carried with it a responsibility which few men would
have dared to face. Sobieski accepted it cheerfully, yet at the
outset of the campaign he had to meet two difficulties, which he
had not foreseen. His old enemy, Michael Paz, caused much delay
by arriving late with his Lithuanians (Sept. 16th); and at the
last moment the king announced that he should put himself at the
head of the force. He came, and reviewed the troops; but during
the ceremony he was seized with illness; and the next morning the
Poles raised a hurra on seeing the “bonzuk,” or long lance, in
front of the Grand General’s tent in an upright position—a sure
sign that the king had quitted the army. The next day (October
11th), with a force of nearly 40,000 men, and forty small
field-pieces, Sobieski began his march.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">His plan of the campaign.</span>His
plan of the campaign, though simple, was boldly conceived. Having
heard that Caplan Pacha, with 30,000 men, was advancing through
Moldavia to reinforce the camp at Kotzim, he proposed to cut him
off upon his march, and then to turn upon the camp itself. If he
should succeed in capturing it, he hoped to isolate Kaminiec, and
so to take it by blockade, and recover all that had been ceded to
the Porte. He was not dismayed at the lateness of the season; for
he trusted that on this account the Turks would be less willing
to fight.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">March of the army.</span>The banks of
the Dniester were reached after three weeks’ march, and here
a mutiny broke out among the troops, which was industriously
fomented by Michael Paz. They clamoured for rest and provisions;
Sobieski promised them both under the tents of the barbarians.
“My resolution,” said he, “is not to be shaken. I intend to bury
myself here or to conquer. You must do the same, or nothing can
save you.” His firmness had the desired effect. They crossed
the Dniester and penetrated into the forest of Bucovina; but
Sobieski was obliged to alter his original plans. It would have
been madness to wait for Caplan Pacha and so give him time to
join the camp; and yet his undisciplined soldiery shrank from
the inclement plains of Moldavia. He therefore turned aside, and
advanced at once on the entrenchments at Kotzim.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Castle and camp of Kotzim.</span>The
castle of that name was strongly situated on the right bank of
the Dniester, about twelve miles from Kaminiec. Between this and
the advancing Poles, at the height of twenty feet from the plain,
was the vast fortified camp, unassailable on the side of the
river, where the rocks were steep, and surrounded on the other
sides by a broad ravine. The ground immediately in front of the
entrenchments was marshy, and broken up by rapid streams, and
the Turks could sweep it from end to end with their admirable
artillery. Within the lines were ranged<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_28">[28]</span> 80,000 men, the flower of the
Turkish army, most of them spahis and janissaries, under the
command of the Seraskier<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46"
class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Hussein.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Insubordination of Paz.</span>The day
after the Poles arrived (November 10th) Paz declared an assault
to be impracticable, and announced his intention to retire.
Sobieski replied with truth that flight was not in their power
except at the risk of extermination. The enterprise indeed
seemed superhuman; but the Grand General ranged his troops in
order of battle with full confidence of success. During the day
a large body of Moldavians and Wallachians,<a id="FNanchor_47"
href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> who occupied a
spot on the left of the Turkish camp, deserted to the Poles,
and greatly raised their drooping spirits. When night came on,
the troops were still kept under arms, although the weather was
most severe. The snow fell thickly, but Sobieski visited all the
posts, and animated the men by his cheerful manner. At length he
reclined on the carriage of a cannon and waited for the dawn.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Crisis in Sobieski’s life.</span>It
was the crisis of his great career; yet he could not but regard
the scene as one of happy omen. On this spot, more than fifty
years before, his father had gained a splendid victory over
the Turks, which was followed by a long peace. Then indeed
the Poles were the defenders instead of the assailants of the
entrenchments; but that only made the victory in prospect seem a
more glorious prize.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">He attacks the entrenchments.</span>At
length the day broke, and Sobieski observed the enemy’s lines
much thinner than before. Many of the Turks, exhausted by the
unwonted cold, had sought their tents, not dreaming for one
moment that the Poles would dare to attack them in daylight.
“This is the moment that I waited for,” cried Sobieski to his
staff, and ordered at once a general assault. After galloping
down the lines with a few encouraging words, he alighted
from his horse, and led the infantry and his own dismounted
dragoons against the entrenchments. The Turks, whose attention
was distracted by a false attack on another side, left a weak
point in his front, and Sobieski, though somewhat bulky, was
the first to scale the parapet. He was splendidly supported
by his dragoons; and the battle now raged in the midst of the
tents. The infantry might possibly have been surrounded, had
not Jablonowski, Palatine of Russia, dashed up a steep place
with the best of the cavalry, and rushed to the rescue. <span
class="sidenote">Rout of the Turks,</span>Sobieski was supplied
with a horse, and the Turks now began to give way on all sides.
Soliman Pacha, at the head of the janissaries, tried to retreat
in good order to the plain; but he was charged by the Lithuanians
in front and by the Poles in the rear,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_29">[29]</span> and his fine troops were cut
to pieces. He is said to have himself fallen by the hand
of Sobieski, who despoiled him of his jewelled scimitar.<a
id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
The Turks fled in confused masses to the bridge leading to the
castle; but Sobieski had provided against this by sending his
brother-in-law, Radziwill, with a large detachment to seize
it. The only retreat now left them was the steep rock on the
river-side, from which thousands precipitated themselves into
the stream; <span class="sidenote">And complete victory of the
Poles.</span>but the Polish cavalry dashed in after them, and
completed their destruction. The carnage lasted more than three
hours, during which half the Turkish force was slain, and a large
number taken prisoners. A remnant of the original force succeeded
in escaping to Kaminiec, among whom was the Seraskier Hussein.<a
id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Question of the prisoners.</span>It
is difficult to credit the statement of some historians,
none of whom are contemporaries, that Sobieski put all the
prisoners to the sword.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50"
class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Such an act would have been opposed
alike to his natural disposition and to his defensive policy.
Plain facts are against it; for some days later the commander at
Kaminiec, delighted at the generous terms which he granted to the
garrison of the castle (November 13th,), released fifty prisoners
without ransom. Had such an enormity been committed, it must
certainly have reached his ears, and would have met with a prompt
revenge.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Joy of the Poles.</span>Immediately
after the victory, the Jesuit confessor of Sobieski erected
an altar in the pavilion of the Seraskier, and the whole
army, with tears of joy, attended a thanksgiving service. The
occasion was indeed affecting, especially to their commander.
Ere long Christendom was resounding with the praises of one
who had obtained the greatest victory over the infidel since
the battle of Ascalon. Sobieski was most anxious to follow up
his success. Honour forbade him to desert the Moldavians and
Wallachians, who had come over to him at considerable risk;
and he wished to cut off from the Turks all chance of return.
<span class="sidenote">Their advance upon the Danube.</span>He
put his cavalry in motion towards the Danube with the hope of
encountering Caplan Pacha. But that general, on hearing of the
disaster at Kotzim, retreated in all haste, and took with him the
Turkish garrisons on the left bank of the Danube. Such was the
panic in Turkey that the Sultan, who had advanced to Silistria,
hurried back to his capital. But the victorious advance of the
Poles was stopped, as they were entering Wallachia, by the news
of the death of their king.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>

<p><span class="sidenote">Death of Michael.</span>On the night
before the battle of Kotzim (November 10th), Michael breathed his
last at Leopol. His death was caused by disease of the kidneys,
but he had hastened his end by the gluttonous voracity of his
appetite, which passed all bounds. He is said to have devoured
in a few hours a thousand Chinese apples, presented to him by
the municipality of Dantzic. His last hours were embittered
by the fruits of his pusillanimous submission to the Turks.
A few days before his death a Turkish Aga<a id="FNanchor_51"
href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> arrived, bearing
the caphtan, or robe of vassalage, which the Sultan sends to his
tributaries. The king was too ill to receive him, and he had to
depart without executing his commission.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">His character.</span>The incapacity
of Michael deserves our pity, because the crown was thrust upon
him against his will. But he was worse than incapable. Envy and
fear alternately gained the mastery over his despicable nature.
His evil genius pursued him to the end. Such was the general
exultation at the victory of Kotzim that there was no pretence of
mourning for him; and his body was conveyed to Warsaw, almost
unnoticed, beneath the triumphal arches erected in honour of his
rival.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Exultation in Poland.</span>Three
weeks elapsed after Michael’s death before the news of the Grand
General’s victory arrived at Warsaw (December 4th), and in the
interval the Poles had given up the army for lost. It is somewhat
surprising that in a nation so excitable the sudden revulsion of
feeling did not result at once in the proclamation of Sobieski.
Madame de Sevigné,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52"
class="fnanchor">[52]</a> writing just after the news arrived in
Paris (December 22nd), says that there no one doubted that he
would be elected. The official journals of France speak of him as
“worthy of the throne which he had saved.” But the Grand General
himself was aware what a stormy opposition his candidature
would raise among the Lithuanians. It was thus with unfeigned
sorrow that he received the orders of the primate-interrex to
bring back his victorious troops. Everything remained to be done
towards reaping the benefits of his glorious success. The Turks
were still in Kaminiec; Moldavia and Wallachia were yet to be
freed; and the Cossacks who had sent in their submission had to
be confirmed in their allegiance. <span class="sidenote">Return
of the Polish army.</span>He did all he could. Though his men
deserted him daily by hundreds for the more profitable field of
election, he left a garrison in Kotzim, and detached 8,000 men
for the defence of his two allies. Then, with a heavy heart,
he retraced his steps to Leopol. He was here met by deputies
from the most distant palatinates, who showered upon him their
congratulations; but he showed no disposition to proceed
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
Warsaw. He knew too well the activity of his enemies in the Diet,
and he was quite content that it should appear that he had no
personal pretensions.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53"
class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Projects of the queen.</span>While
her late husband was still lying in state the queen had resumed
her favourite project of retaining the crown by a marriage
with Charles of Lorraine. That prince left the army of the
Rhine and appeared upon the frontiers; and the emperor massed
troops for his support on the borders of Little Poland. <span
class="sidenote">Candidates.</span>Sixteen<a id="FNanchor_54"
href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> other candidates
appeared in the field, but many of these were Protestant
princes, whose chances were small; and the contest seemed to
lie between Lorraine and the young Duke of Neuberg, the son of
his old antagonist. The latter, though a German prince, was
supported by Louis XIV. as the heir of the Elector Palatine, and
therefore an important ally. <span class="sidenote">Preparations
for the election.</span>No artifice was spared by the queen’s
party to prevent the proposal of Sobieski. The Pazes brought
forward a measure in the Diet for the exclusion of a Piast on
account of the misfortunes of the late reign; and when this
was unfavourably received, they insisted that the new king
must be unmarried.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55"
class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The Diet refused to sanction any
measures of exclusion, and wrote to press for Sobieski’s
presence. But the hero was now at Zolkiew attending his wife in
a dangerous illness, upon the origin of which various rumours
were afloat. His enemies averred that he had poisoned her
himself to secure the queen’s hand; his friends hinted that
the queen had done so to be sure of the crown at all hazards.
These speculations were set at rest by the recovery of Madame
Sobieska; but her husband still delayed to appear in public. He
wrote, however, to the Diet, strongly urging that the threatening
attitude of the Turks rendered any delay dangerous; and it was
decided on this advice that the election should not be made
by the whole Pospolite, but by a representative Diet. But the
regulation was practically ineffective; for the Diet being held
in the open air, the nobles attended as usual to watch the
conduct of their deputies.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The field of election.</span>The field
of Wola, close to Warsaw, was the scene of this unique spectacle.
On the day when the Diet of election met (April 20) all the
orders of the state attended a grand service at the cathedral,
and then set out on horseback for the field. In the midst of the
plain was pitched the “szopa,” or grand pavilion of the Senate,
surrounded by a ditch to keep off intruders, and carefully
closed to the public.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]
</span> Not far off, under the open sky, sat the “kolo”
or circle of deputies from the palatinates. Round it were ranged
100,000 of the nobility, jealously watching each turn of their
deliberations. Every human passion found vent in this motley
assemblage. Riots were frequent, and seldom ended without
effusion of blood. Each noble was attended by as many valets as
he could muster, who were generally a worse element of disorder
than their lords. To these must be added a crowd of mercenaries
from neighbouring nations, all eagerly intriguing for their
national candidate. Long tables were set up as the head-quarters
of each faction, and at these was heard an unceasing babel of
noisy tongues. In the vacant spaces of the arena jousts were
frequent, for which each palatinate brought out a splendid
cavalcade. This was the occasion when all gratified the national
craving for display. Many a poor noble would readily sell his
vote, perhaps to more than one candidate, for the pleasure of
donning a brilliant attire. Costly furs adorned their persons,
and were almost hidden beneath a profusion of jewels. The same
reckless display of the precious metals was seen in their
accoutrements. Nor were the bishops outdone by the cavaliers.
Green, broad-brimmed hats, with yellow or red pantaloons, were
the common ornaments of the soldiers of the Church. Every kind
of merchandise was represented. The Jews, who were ordinarily
interdicted from appearing in Warsaw, made the most of the short
period when the restriction was removed. The plain around the
“szopa” was dotted with an immense multitude of tents, most of
them devoted to buying and selling, but all decorated in the
most gorgeous style. Several pavilions of superb workmanship and
oriental magnificence, containing a large suite of luxurious
chambers, attracted special attention. They were the quarters
of the Seraskier Hussein—transported entire from the camp at
Kotzim—and were now surmounted by the shield of Sobieski.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Absence of Sobieski.</span>Nothing more
was wanting to kindle the liveliest enthusiasm for the absent
general. His name was in every mouth, and his non-appearance
caused much surprise. The “kolo” elected as their marshal the
Lithuanian Sapieha, a personal friend of the Grand General;
and when Michael Paz pushed his hatred so far as to revive his
proposal for the exclusion of a Piast (April 15), the attempt was
so invidious that a party began to form in Sobieski’s favour,
though their designs were at first studiously concealed.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">His arrival.</span>On the 2nd of May
it was announced that Sobieski was approaching Warsaw. His
arrival on the plain created the most unbounded enthusiasm;
the Diet rose and went to meet him; and his progress for miles
resembled a triumph. Sixty-six banners—the spoil of Kotzim—were
carried before him, to be his present, as he said, to his future
king; and behind him marched a corps of captive janissaries,
who were enrolled as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]
</span> his body-guard. Like his countrymen, he did not
disdain ostentation; for on the croup of his horse hung a shield
of gold, embossed with scenes from his great career. Nature
had gifted him with handsome features and a dignified mien.<a
id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
Though stout, he was tall and erect; and his full flashing eye
marked him at once as a man of frankness, bravery, and powers
of observation. Yet along with his military air his face wore a
sweetness of expression, which was indescribably attractive. Few
of the Pules could have witnessed his entry without feeling that
he was the fittest person to be their king.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">He proposes the Prince of
Condé.</span>Two days after (May 4) the Senate forsook the
“szopa” and took their seat in the “kolo;” and Sobieski, rising
in his place, proposed the Prince of Condé, whose military
qualities, he said, made him the proper choice of a nation which
would have to struggle for its existence. This unexpected event
caused an immense commotion. The vast multitude was split into
the old factions of France and Austria, and for days it seemed
as if there was no solution but civil war. At length (May 19)
Sobieski consented to withdraw the name of Condé if the queen
would consent to marry the Duke of Neuberg. Hoping against hope
for the success of her party, Eleanor rejected this offer with
disdain; and the Lithuanians, who were encamped on the other
side of the Vistula, assumed a menacing attitude towards the
Polish Pospolite. At this crisis the Bishop of Cracow, who
was discharging the functions of interrex,<a id="FNanchor_57"
href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> gave orders for the
singing of the canticles with which the debates were accustomed
to close. The familiar chant and its associations produced a
dead calm in the tempestuous assembly, and at its conclusion the
prelate ordered each palatinate to range itself round the banner
of its palatine. <span class="sidenote">Jablonowski proposes
Sobieski.</span>While his orders were being obeyed, Jablonowski,
palatine of Red Russia, the home of Sobieski, took advantage of
the silence to address all those within hearing. He represented
Lorraine as too devoted to the empire, Neuberg as too young,
Condé as too old, to command their armies with vigour. The times,
he said, required a prince who was well acquainted alike with
them and with their military system. He was here interrupted
with loud shouts of “A Piast!” a sound which soon collected
round the speaker all the surging masses of the Pospolite. The
palatine continued, “Among ourselves is a man whose sacrifices
for his country have caused him to be everywhere considered the
first of the sons of Poland. In placing him at our head we shall
do no more than consecrate his own glory; fortunate<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span> to be able to
honour by one title the more the remainder of a life, of which
every day has been dedicated to the republic. We know that such
a king will maintain our nation in the rank which it occupies in
the world. Such a man as he is will never make himself a vassal
of the infidel. Poles, if we are deliberating here in peace on
the election of a king, if the most illustrious dynasties are
courting our suffrages, if our liberty remains secure, if even
we have a country left to us, to whom do we owe it? Remember the
marvels of Slobodyszcza, of Podhaic, of Kalusz, above all, of
Kotzim, and take for your king John Sobieski!”<a id="FNanchor_58"
href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>A tempest of applause followed this speech, and as it subsided
the voice of one of the castellans was heard calling upon the
Poles to elect that man whom the Turks would be most anxious to
exclude. Then from the midst of the host rose loud shouts of
“Long live King John Sobieski!” and thirteen palatinates at once
took up the cry. The regular soldiers pressed forward towards
the szopa, exclaiming, “We will all perish together, or have for
our king John Sobieski!” It was already late in the evening, but
the Polish nobility crowded round the interrex, and besought
him to take the votes. <span class="sidenote">He postpones the
voting.</span>One voice alone was raised against the proposition;
it was that of Sobieski. He firmly declared that he could not
accept the crown if it was offered at the fall of night, and
in a manner so sudden that no one could have time to recollect
himself. “If,” said he, “there is no other protest against the
election being made this night, I shall oppose my veto.” This
disinterested advice was unwillingly followed, and Sobieski left
the plain to encounter the reproaches of his wife.</p>

<p>Several writers—principally the later Polish historians,
who treat him with marked disfavour—endeavour to detect in his
conduct throughout the proceedings the signs of crafty intrigue.
<span class="sidenote">And shows his fair dealing.</span> Yet by
this last step he allowed his enemies time to combine against
him, and gave the queen’s party a fair opportunity of reviving
their scattered energies. But such generosity is often the best
policy. The succeeding night and day (May 20th) were spent
in a general effort to secure unanimity; and the riches and
influence of his brother-in-law, Radziwill, were of much service
to Sobieski in the Lithuanian camp. But his own popularity was
still more effectual. It had ever been the privilege of the
Grand General of Poland to quarter his army where he pleased,
and pay nothing for their maintenance. Bribes had formerly been
freely taken from those districts that desired exemption,<a
id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
but Sobieski, unwilling to exercise such tyranny, had always<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span> quartered his army
on the frontiers. This was now remembered with gratitude. <span
class="sidenote">His offers to the republic.</span>His promises
to the republic also became the topic of admiring conversation.
He engaged to pay the pension to the queen dowager, to redeem
the crown jewels, to found a military school for the young
nobility, to build two fortresses wherever the Diet should
appoint, and to furnish the regular army with six months’ pay.
Early in the day two of the family of Paz came to register their
opposition with the interrex, but before night fell they had
been persuaded to forego it. <span class="sidenote">Proclamation
of Sobieski.</span>The next morning Sobieski was proclaimed
king amid the acclamations of both Principalities, and took the
name of John III. The same day a vast crowd attended him to the
cathedral of St. John to return thanks for his election.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Opinion of Europe.</span>Europe in
general was less astonished at his elevation than Poland. At
Constantinople and at Vienna alone the news was received with
disfavour. Köprili saw less chance of recovering his conquests;
and the emperor was bitterly mortified to see upon the throne
one who had always belonged to the faction of France. Poland was
daily becoming of greater importance in the struggle between
Louis and Leopold. When the republic was bleeding from the
shocks of her barbarous neighbours, and from a succession of
internal troubles, it mattered little to these great potentates
who filled the throne; but now that she had proved herself
strong enough to withstand the dreaded Turk, and wise enough
to offer the crown to her victorious general, she was looked
upon with a respect to which she had hitherto been a stranger.
This was fully appreciated at the Papal Court. Clement X.,
besides his benediction, sent assurances of friendship to the
new king; and Oliva, the general of the Jesuits, wrote his
joyful congratulations to “the pillar of the republic and the
avenger of Christendom.” It is difficult to discover how far
the court of France had a hand in his election. Its ambassador,
Forbin-Janson, bishop of Marseilles, arrived somewhat late (May
8th), and certainly brought instructions to support the Duke
of Neuberg. But he probably discovered ere long which way the
tide was setting, and, adapting himself to circumstances with a
Frenchman’s ready wit, he caused it to be supposed that he had
used his influence in favour of Sobieski. Louis XIV. followed the
same course; and in an official note of the same summer claimed
this election as one more instance of the universal triumph of
his policy.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Schemes of the king’s
enemies.</span>The machinations of the enemies of Sobieski did
not cease with the withdrawal of their veto. Their first move
was to give notice of a law which should oblige him to divorce
his wife and marry the queen dowager. But on this point the
king was firm. “I have not yet finally promised,” said he, “to
accept the royal functions. If this is the price of your<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span> sceptre, you need
not offer it.” The proposal was soon dropped; and Eleanor, after
receiving a visit from the king, retired to Thorn, whence she
still exercised a baneful influence upon the course of affairs.
Four years later (1678) she gave her hand to her old suitor, the
Prince of Lorraine.</p>

<p>Whilst the Diet was drawing up the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pacta conventa</i>,
Sobieski discovered from an examination of his revenues that
he could not fulfil his promise of paying the army for six
months. Without delay he frankly owned his inability; and his
opponents made this a pretext for inserting in the contract
new restrictions on the military authority of the king. They
also wished to bind him to an eternal alliance with the court
of Vienna. It was soon known that the king would not yield to
these terms; and several stormy scenes took place in the Diet.
At length the obnoxious articles were struck out; and on the 5th
June the king received the instrument of his election from the
hands of the interrex.</p>

<p>There now remained only the ceremony of coronation—which was
a necessary prelude to the exercise of the royal functions.
<span class="sidenote">Danger from the Turks.</span>But the
steady advance of the Turks grew daily more disquieting. Caplan
Pacha had rallied the remnants of the defeated force, and the
Sultan was already marching with a great army through Bulgaria.
John saw that the delay would be dangerous, and had the courage
to disappoint the queen<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60"
class="fnanchor">[60]</a> and the whole court by deferring
the ceremony. He told the Senate that at such a time a helmet
became his forehead better than a diadem. “I know well,” said he,
“that I have been elected, not to represent the republic, but to
fight for her. I will first fulfil my mission.” Touched by his
magnanimity, the Diet resolved to place in his hands at once all
the powers of a king.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">They invade the Ukraine.</span>Meantime
the Turks, accompanied by the Tartars, had appeared in great
force before the camp at Kotzim. The Polish commander, terrified
at their numbers, soon surrendered, and the whole garrison was
put to the sword. But instead of advancing into the heart of
Poland, Köprili turned to the right into the Ukraine, where the
Muscovites, who also laid claim to that territory, now lined the
Borysthenes with 100,000 men. Hearing that he was occupied in
besieging small places in the Ukraine, John promised to render a
good account of him before the close of the campaign. He kept his
word. <span class="sidenote">Campaign of 1674.</span>While the
Turks drove the Muscovites beyond the river, he suddenly appeared
in Podolia and besieged Bar. The Sultan, who was distracted by
news of intrigues at his capital and the advance of the Sophy
upon Babylon, suddenly broke up his camp, and made for Silistria.
The Tartars disappeared at the sound of “the Polish hurricane,”
as they called Sobieski; and John<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_37">[37]</span> was left to deal with the hapless
country which had but just suffered from the Ottoman invasion.
<span class="sidenote">John winters in the Ukraine.</span>He
could see no mode of protecting its peasants from the yoke of
the nobility but to place his army in winter quarters in the
neighbourhood, and to teach the cavalry by his own example what
clemency and what self-sacrifice they ought to show towards a
subject people. Resistance was only to be expected; for his
haughty hussars had never before passed a winter away from their
estates. But when they saw their king take up his abode in the
miserable town of Braclaw, where the scarcity of forage increased
the hardships of the season, the Polish cavalry submitted without
a murmur.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Lithuanians desert him.</span>Not
so, however, did the Lithuanians. The king had assigned to Paz
the town of Bar, the most comfortable post on the frontiers.
Yet that general did not approve of the innovation, and taking
the law into his own hands marched home with his army. This
defection was a great blow to the king. He had begun to invest
Kaminiec, and had opened negotiations for an alliance with
Muscovy. He now saw himself obliged to narrow his plans, and to
confine himself to the defensive. The desertion of Paz aroused
the strongest indignation in Poland, and he was forced to ask
the king’s pardon; but he could not now repair the mischief.
His disbanded troops were amusing themselves with pillaging
their own country,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61"
class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and there was no chance at present of
rallying them round their standards.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Campaign of 1675.</span>The winter
passed without any important success; and early in April
another large Turkish army, commanded by Ibrahim Pacha,<a
id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
nicknamed “Schischman” from his enormous bulk, advanced into
Volhynia. John hastily quitted the Ukraine and disposed his small
forces for the defence of Russia in a vast arc, of which Leopol
was the centre. So completely was he outnumbered that his only
chance of success seemed to lie in procuring allies. He continued
to treat with the Czar, and received at Leopol with ostentatious
pomp an ambassador from the Sophy of Persia; but he could hope
little from the latter, except the chance of terrifying the
Sultan by a supposed coalition with his Asiatic enemy.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Lethargy of the Poles.</span>Meanwhile
Ibrahim had copied the fault of the preceding year by wasting
time in small sieges, and it was not till he received a
threatening message from Köprili that he began to advance upon
the Polish force covering Leopol, which hardly amounted to 15,000
men. No exertions on the part of the king could awaken Poland to
a sense of its danger.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]
</span> Servitude had numbed the senses of the peasants,
and the nobles were wearied with the length of the war. Ibrahim
seemed unwilling to trust his fortune against that of Sobieski.
Sitting down before Trembowla, a strong fortress in Podolia, he
sent on the Tartar Noureddin with 40,000 men “to bring the king
before him dead or alive.”</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Battle of Leopol.</span>It was
late in August when this detachment<a id="FNanchor_63"
href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>—the flower of the
Turkish army—arrived at Leopol, and began to burn the suburbs.
The Poles besought the king to retire, and not risk his life in
so deadly a combat. “You would despise me,” said he, “if I were
to follow your advice.” The ground in the vicinity was undulating
and covered with vineyards, and John carefully made his
dispositions in order to conceal from the enemy the smallness of
his force. He planted several hills, which he could not occupy,
with the spare lances of his hussars, and concealed squadrons
in the valleys near the point of attack. Then, on the 24th of
August, amidst a storm of snow and hail which beat in the faces
of the enemy, he suddenly charged the infidels at the head of
5,000 cavalry, repeating thrice the name of Jesus. The impetuous
bravery of the Poles spread terror in the Turkish ranks, and
before nightfall the whole force, though at least eight times the
number of their assailants, had fled in disorder. The storm was
so unusual for the time of year that contemporary memoirs speak
of it as miraculous; and it appears that this battle, more than
any other, contributed to cause the superstitious fear with
which the Turkish troops subsequently regarded John Sobieski.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Siege of Trembowla.</span>Ibrahim was
dismayed at the king’s success. He had captured the position
of Podhaic, but he could not reduce the garrison of Trembowla,
commanded by Chrasonowski, a man of determined courage. He now
redoubled his assault upon that place, which must have fallen but
for the arrival of John with the Polish army. The king posted his
troops to advantage and prepared for the attack; but during the
night (Oct. 6th) Ibrahim intercepted a letter to the besieged,
which informed him that the king in person was at the head of
the Poles. <span class="sidenote">Retreat of the Turks.</span>He
at once raised the siege, and without striking a blow retreated
precipitately to Kaminiec, and thence across the Danube. John
would have pursued him beyond the outskirts of Podolia, but the
Polish vanguard, dreading a winter’s campaign in the enemy’s
country, set fire to the bridges, and compelled their king to
suspend his march.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Return of the king.</span>The whole
country clamoured for his return, and the Diet was impatient to
return thanks to its deliverer. The Vice-chancellor declared
in the Senate that the king moved like a tortoise towards the
throne, but like an eagle towards the enemies of the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span> republic. He was
now ready to gratify the general wish, and returning to Zolkiew
received a number of foreign ambassadors sent to congratulate him
upon his election,—among them Lawrence Hyde, Earl of Rochester,<a
id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
whom Dr. South was attending as domestic chaplain. The French
ambassador solicited John’s alliance against Brandenburg and the
empire, and held out hopes of persuading the Turks to make peace.
But the king deferred all fresh engagements for the present; his
grand aim in life was to save Poland from the Ottoman grasp.</p>

<p>Cracow was, as usual, the scene of the coronation,
which was fixed for the 2nd of February (1676). <span
class="sidenote">Burial of the two last kings.</span>Two
days earlier, according to the Polish custom, John followed
to the grave the body of Michael, and the interest of the
ceremony was deepened on this occasion by the obsequies of
Casimir. The ex-king had died three years before, of grief,
it was said, at the fall of Kaminiec.<a id="FNanchor_65"
href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> The reigns of
the two deceased kings, so fruitful in misfortunes to Poland,
comprised the whole of Sobieski’s wonderful career, and it was
fitting that their royal mourner should be he to whose prowess
they were chiefly indebted for retaining the crown. <span
class="sidenote">Coronation.</span>The coronation took place amid
general rejoicings, broken only by a few murmurs when the crown
was set upon the queen’s head. It was not long before she showed
her unfitness to wear it.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Diet of 1676.</span>Two days later
(February 4th) the Diet met, and was conspicuous for its
loyal enthusiasm. The king was entreated not to lay down the
office of Grand General, but he wisely refused a privilege so
invidious, and conferred the post upon his old enemy, Demetrius
Wiesnowiesçki. He displayed the same generous spirit in his other
appointments, offering the primacy to Olzowski, the favourite of
Eleanor, and the Grand Marshalate to Lubomirski, son of his old
rival. The brave Jablonowski was rewarded with the post of Second
General. His elevation caused some trouble. The Diet proposed to
make these dignities triennial, which, in the present reign at
least, would have been a salutary enhancement of the royal power;
but the queen, out of gratitude to Jablonowski, worked hard in
secret to defeat the proposal. The king, though he favoured it at
heart, appeared neutral; and the project fell through.</p>

<p>John availed himself of the favourable temper of the Diet
to take exceptional measures for the national defence. He
proposed a capitation subsidy upon all alike, clergy as well as
laity, and strongly urged the necessity of forming a permanent
infantry. Hitherto this branch of the service had been fixed
at one-third of the regular army (16,000), but it had never
reached this standard,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]
</span> and being composed only of the peasants and poorer
nobles, commanded by foreign officers, its equipment was
disgracefully inefficient.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66"
class="fnanchor">[66]</a> The Diet voted that the army should
be raised to 73,000 men, thus augmenting it by 25,000,<a
id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
and that of these 35,000 should be infantry. No king had ever
obtained such concessions from the nobility, but they were not
granted without a violent opposition. The old expedient was tried
of drawing out the Diet, but John defeated it by submitting to
a continuous sitting, and presiding upon the throne for forty
consecutive hours. He was able to announce that the Great Elector
had promised him succours, and that he hoped for an alliance with
Muscovy. The Diet did not rise before paying him the unusual
compliment of a decree that all the starosties which he had
held should remain hereditary in his family.<a id="FNanchor_68"
href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The king fails to levy
troops.</span>Unfortunately their good resolutions were
not carried into effect. Although the Dietines ratified their
proceedings, it was beyond the king’s power to overcome the
inertness and lethargy of the nobility. The patriotic spirit
died out at once when the magic of his personal influence was
withdrawn. Seizing upon a rumour which was industriously raised
by Austria, that the king was treating in secret with the Turks
and would use the money for his own purposes, they refused to pay
the subsidy, and threw every obstacle in his way. John hastily
assembled at Leopol those troops which had not been disbanded;
but, although their number is variously stated, some even placing
it as low as 10,000, it probably did not amount to one-half of
the force that the Diet had decreed.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Armament of the Turks.</span>Meanwhile,
Köprili had not been idle. He assembled an army of 100,000 Turks,
to be accompanied by a vast host of Tartars. But his aim was
more pacific than in the former campaigns. He was beset by the
proffered mediation of the European powers, especially of Louis
XIV., who wished to evade his promise of sending armed assistance
to Poland. Moreover, the condition of Asiatic Turkey distracted
his attention; his allies, the Cossacks and the Tartars, inspired
him with distrust; and he felt that his fortune was outshone by
the star of John Sobieski. The name of the Polish hero was such
a terror in the Ottoman ranks that threats alone could induce
many of the officers to serve against him. Köprili looked out
anxiously for a competent general. He chose Ibrahim, Pacha of
Damascus, called “Shaitan” (Satan), from his combined bravery
and cunning, and gave him instructions to procure an honourable
peace.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>

<p><span class="sidenote">Invasion of Galicia.</span>Ibrahim
secretly hoped to do more than this, for he was confident that
he could drive the king to extremities. He pushed on at once
into Galicia and crossed the Dniester, expecting that John would
attack him; but finding that the king lay inactive at Zurawno,
a small town on the left bank, he advanced against him without
delay. John called in his squadrons of horse, which had been
harassing the Tartars, and prepared to improve his position. It
had been chosen with admirable judgment. He lay with the Dniester
and the mountains behind it covering his rear, while his left
rested on the town of Zurawno, and his right was protected by
woods and marshes. In front of his lines ran a rapid torrent,
called the Swiczza, which was easily fordable, and offered
facilities for the construction of entrenchments. On this task
John employed his whole army, and collected all the provisions
within reach. When the seraskier appeared on the heights in his
front, he left his lines and offered him battle (September 25th);
but this was declined, for all the Turkish troops had not yet
come up. <span class="sidenote">Siege of Zurawno.</span>Ibrahim,
when he had assembled them, formed them into a vast arc,
including the town of Zurawno, the Polish army, and the wood on
its right, with each of his wings resting on the river. He then
commenced a regular siege. His artillery was splendidly handled;
and his miners rapidly approached the Polish entrenchments.
John at once employed counter-mines, but the experience of the
Turks in Candia gave them a vast superiority. The king was
anxious to bring on a general action, and in a skirmish on the
29th of September the Poles had the advantage, but they lost
heavily. John’s situation was becoming desperate; the Tartars
who commanded the river prevented the arrival of provisions by
that route; and the Turkish artillery made frightful havoc in his
ranks.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Proposals of peace.</span>The liveliest
alarm prevailed in Poland. The Senate called out the Pospolite
and placed Prince Radziwill at its head; but the assembling of
such a body was necessarily slow. Meantime another engagement
took place at Zurawno (October 8th), in which 2,000 Turks were
slain; but John failed to break through the enemy’s lines,
and was once nearly surrounded and cut off from his men by a
body of janissaries. When however the siege had lasted nearly
twenty days, the Tartan khan, whose dominion was menaced
by the Muscovites,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69"
class="fnanchor">[69]</a> pressed Ibrahim to conclude a peace.
The Seraskier knew the straits to which the Poles were reduced,
and he therefore sent an envoy to propose the ratification of
the treaty of Buczacz and an offensive alliance against Muscovy.
<span class="sidenote">Refused by the king.</span>John replied
shortly that he would hang the next man who brought him such a
message.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
The bombardment recommenced, and the soldiers murmured against
their king’s obstinacy. Paz repaired to the royal tent and
announced his intention to desert. “Desert who will,” cried
John, “the Turks shall not reach the heart of the republic
without passing over my corpse.” He then rode down the ranks,
and reminding the soldiers that he had extricated them from many
a worse plight, he gaily asked them if his head were enfeebled
by the weight of a crown. Yet he passed the night in the gravest
anxiety, and when morning broke (October 14th) he quitted his
lines and drew up his whole force in order of battle.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Ibrahim proposes fairer
terms.</span>The Turks were astounded; and the Tartars cried
out that there was magic in his boldness. Brave though he was,
Ibrahim dared not face the chances of a defeat. He knew that the
Pospolite was approaching; he suspected that the Tartars had been
bought over; and he saw winter rapidly closing in. Above all, he
remembered that his instructions were pacific, and that a serious
reverse might cost him his head. <span class="sidenote">Peace of
Zurawno.</span>Before the armies engaged, he proposed a peace
upon honourable terms. No mention was now made of tribute. The
Porte was to retain only Kaminiec and a third of the Ukraine;
the question of Podolia was referred to a subsequent conference;
each army was to restore its prisoners of war. It is said that
Sobieski, with the sentiments of a Christian knight, inserted
an article to provide for the establishment of a Latin guard
at the Holy Sepulchre.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70"
class="fnanchor">[70]</a> After witnessing the release of
15,000 captives, and the departure of the Turks (October 16th),
John retraced his steps to Zolkiew. He soon encountered the
Pospolite, which was advancing to his relief, and the two armies
celebrated the conclusion of peace with a grand flourish of
trumpets.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Great services of the
king.</span>Though satisfactory, the terms were not glorious;
but that they should have been obtained at all by a handful of
men in the direst extremities was cause enough for rejoicing.
A moral triumph like this, following so close upon a crisis so
dreadful, carries with it an air of romance. Yet, making every
allowance for good fortune and the earnest mediation of his
allies, we must regard it as due in the first instance to the
potency of the name of Sobieski. With an insignificant force at
his back he had conducted to a favourable issue five successive
campaigns against the Turks—four of them on Polish ground—and
had previously many times repulsed the hordes of Tartars which
they had poured into the country. By thus foiling the aggression
of the Turks when at the height of their power John III. had
rendered a signal service to Europe.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>

<p><span class="sidenote">Death of Köprili.</span>The minister
whose vast designs he had thwarted was now upon his death-bed.
Seven days after the peace of Zurawno (October 23rd), Köprili
expired at Constantinople. Had it not been for Sobieski this
able vizier would have extended the dependencies of Turkey from
the Black Sea to the Baltic, and would have found a golden
opportunity for his attack upon the empire. His successor
Mustapha, called “Kara,” or “the Black,” was a man of a different
calibre. He owed his advancement to the intrigues of the
seraglio; he had married a daughter of the Sultan and possessed
great influence over his master; and he inherited the ambitious
dreams of Köprili without his ability to realise them.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Enthusiasm of Europe.</span>All Europe,
with the exception perhaps of Austria, rejoiced at the peace of
Zurawno. Madame de Sevigné, writing on the 18th of November,
1676, expresses the general admiration for the hero of Poland;<a
id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
and Condé sent a special messenger to congratulate his friend.
Louis XIV. eagerly sought his alliance. He commissioned his
ambassador in Poland, the Marquis of Bethune, brother-in-law
of the king, to invest him with the order of the Holy Ghost.
John imprudently accepted the honour, and thus, in spite of the
enthusiasm with which he had been received, excited general
murmurs. He was accused of wearing the livery of France, and
binding the republic to follow her interests. In the Diet which
assembled the next year (January, 1677,) his opponents were
clamorous. They complained that, besides part of the Ukraine, he
had given up Kaminiec, the key of the realm; and that instead
of striving to recover them, he was meditating war against
Brandenburg and Austria. They also accused him of aiming at
absolute power by the secret help of the French monarch. The
majority of the Diet, however, did not forget the dangers from
which they had been rescued; and Gninski, palatine of Kulm, was
sent to Constantinople to ratify the peace of Zurawno.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">He supports the designs of
France.</span>No notice was taken of the other charges;
yet John was undoubtedly conniving at the designs of France.
Louis XIV. had promised assistance to the insurgents in Hungary
against the emperor, and was encouraging Sweden to attack the
Great Elector. It is said that he gained over Sobieski by the
promise of ducal Prussia and a larger frontier on the Baltic.
At any rate the Marquis of Bethune was allowed to raise troops
destined for Hungary in the starosties of the king, while secret
permission was given to the Swedes to pass through Courland
to attack the Elector.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72"
class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Frederic William naturally<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span> resented the
attitude of Poland, and in revenge fomented some disturbances
which had arisen in Dantzic.</p>

<p>This prosperous centre of commerce enjoyed, as a Hanse town,
a large share of independence. Though belonging to the republic
of Poland, it was governed by its own magistrates and its own
laws. <span class="sidenote">Disturbances in Dantzic,</span>A
religious struggle had broken out between the magistrates,
who were Calvinists, and the people, who were headed by an
eloquent Lutheran preacher. <span class="sidenote">Quieted by
the king.</span>John at once visited the city and mediated
between the contending parties (September, 1677), and the
unusual spectacle was presented of a Catholic acting as arbiter
in a Protestant dispute. His moderation won all hearts, and
tranquillity was soon restored. The astronomer Hevelius, who was
one of the chief citizens, entertained the king in his house,
and entitled his newly-found constellation, “Scutum Sobieski.”<a
id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Activity of the Turks.</span>John
was recalled from Dantzic by the serious intelligence that the
new Grand Vizier was placing every obstacle in the way of the
conclusion of peace. He kept the Polish envoy for months at
the gates of Constantinople; and when at length he gave him an
audience, his tone was haughty and unconciliatory. The Austrian
court, fearing for itself, had done its utmost to persuade the
Porte that the peace of Zurawno was disgraceful to Turkey, and
Mustapha, who longed for military glory, encouraged the idea.
His first blow, however, was to fall on Muscovy. The Czar
Feodor hastened to conclude the treaty with Poland, which had
long been pending, but he could look for no assistance from the
republic. He was worsted in the campaign which followed, but
the vizier, disgusted at the rigour of the climate, looked out
for a more alluring prey. His first thought was to reopen the
war with Poland; and he announced that he should keep her envoy
as a hostage until Podolia was ceded to the Porte (September,
1678).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Coldness of John towards
France.</span>John now saw clearly that the danger from Turkey
was still pressing. He therefore at once withdrew his support
from the French designs in the west, and prepared to confront
his old enemy. <span class="sidenote">Reasons.</span>This change
in his policy is reasonable enough. He saw that the Hungarian
insurgents would probably call in the Porte, and in that case
his natural ally would be Austria, while from France he could
expect no material help. His judgment was most sagacious; but it
was not uninfluenced by personal reasons. He was offended at the
pride of the French king, who had refused him on his accession
the coveted title of “Majesty,” and had lately treated his
queen with some contempt. Immediately after her coronation, his
queen had set out for France to take the waters of Bourbon,<a
id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
and to display<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]
</span> her dignity in her native country; but on her way
she encountered the French ambassador, who delicately hinted
that his master could not receive an elective queen with full
honours. The “Grand Monarque” could not stoop to receive on
equal terms the daughter of the captain of his brother’s Swiss
Guards. The queen retraced her steps in great indignation, which
subsequent events only tended to increase. Through her husband
she begged a dukedom for her father, the Marquis d’Arquien, but
Louis, though his language was fair, deferred compliance.<a
id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
Moreover, John could not but regard with disgust the scarcely
concealed efforts of France to set the Turks in motion against
the house of Austria. The king himself had throughout his life
distrusted Austria and counteracted her influence in Poland,
but his chivalrous spirit would have revolted from bringing the
infidel against her. He now perceived that it was his policy to
make common cause with her.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">His designs upon Kaminiec.</span>He was
anxious to strike the first blow against the Turks by surprising
Kaminiec, which was poorly guarded; but for this the consent
of the Diet was necessary. He had to publish his universals<a
id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> to
the Dietines describing his projects, and to debate the question
in the Diet when assembled. This year (1679) it was convened at
Grodno, in Lithuania, and so stormy was the session that it was
four months before the king’s proposal passed. The Turks were
thus enabled to strengthen and re-victual the town at their
leisure; and nothing was left to the king but to send ambassadors
to the European courts to propose a general league against the
Sultan.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arming of the Turks.</span>A vast
armament was in preparation at Constantinople, and no one in
Europe knew against whom it would first be directed. Troops were
daily arriving from the interior of Asia, and Greece was made
subject to a searching levy. It was plainly time for the European
powers to show themselves united against the common enemy, but
there was little prospect of such a combination. Louis had lately
concluded a peace with the Emperor at Nimeguen (1679), but it was
scarcely more than a suspension of hostilities.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Polish Embassies in Europe.</span>The
Polish ambassador, Radziwill, had no success at the court of
Vienna. He could not persuade Leopold that he was in greater
danger than Poland. But his proposals were not merely defensive.
He urged the formation of a league, “which should hurl back
the monster into his native deserts, and revive from its
ruins the ancient empire of Byzantium.”<a id="FNanchor_77"
href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> But when he
arrived at Rome (July, 1680) he found<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_46">[46]</span> the Pope very favourably disposed
towards a crusade. The chair was now filled by Innocent XI.,
an Austrian by birth, who feared that Vienna was the object
of attack, and saw at once that Italy must stand or fall with
it. He had been formerly Papal Nuncio in Poland, and in that
capacity had bestowed his blessing on the marriage of Sobieski.
He now promised his hearty aid to the king, whom he styled, “The
invincible lieutenant of the God of armies, that brazen wall
against which all the efforts of the barbarians have been dashed
in pieces.” He agreed forthwith to furnish a large subsidy.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Alliance with the Pope.</span>This
close alliance with the Pope widened the breach between Sobieski
and the court of France. There could be no peace between such
haughty characters as Innocent XI. and Louis XIV., and they were
often at open enmity about the Gallican clergy. Louis hated
the Pope above all things for his sympathy with the Austrian
court. He now sought to counteract his influence by sending
as ambassador to Warsaw Forbin-Janson, at this time bishop
of Beauvais, who was to be assisted by Vitry, a man of great
resource.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Diet of 1681.</span>When the king
assembled the next Diet at Warsaw (Jan. 1681) he found the
French party for the first time arrayed against him. He had to
report that his embassies had met with complete success only
at Rome, but that Savoy and Portugal had sent him their good
wishes. The majority of the Diet supported him in his schemes
against the Porte; but French intrigue protracted the session
for months, and finally dissolved it by the veto on a frivolous
pretext. Indignant at these proceedings, Innocent XI., during
his lifetime, withheld from Forbin-Janson the Cardinal’s hat,
which had been promised him at the accession of Sobieski. <span
class="sidenote">Peace with Turkey.</span>Fortunately, however,
the Grand Vizier suddenly assumed a peaceful attitude towards
Poland, and sent an envoy with conditions which she could
honourably accept. Mustapha was evidently bent on some more vast
design; but though he studiously concealed its nature, John seems
to have divined it from the first.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1681-2.</span>He spent the two
succeeding years in strengthening and disciplining his army, and
in those peaceful employments to which he was so much attached.
At a wild spot, six miles from Warsaw, he constructed his palace
of Willanow, and introduced on his estate the Dutch system of
farming. For a time all the clamours of faction were hushed; but
it was only the calm which heralds the approaching storm.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Designs of Louis XIV.</span>Louis
XIV. had never abandoned his encroachments upon the empire. At
the end of 1681 he availed himself of a legal fiction, created
by his own “Chambers of Reunion,” to occupy Strasburg, Casale,
and other important towns on the imperial frontier. The Diet of
Ratisbon vehemently protested against this spoliation, but in
vain. They did not dare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]
</span> to provoke him to open war; for it was known that
his envoys were strongly urging the Turks to invade Austria. His
plan seems to have been to acquire the glory of saving the Empire
after the fall of its capital, and to exact in return for his
services large territorial concessions. His ambition was to have
the Dauphin proclaimed king of the Romans.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Turks protect Hungary.</span>At
length his policy seemed on the point of success. Kara Mustapha
threw off the mask (1682), and declaring Hungary tributary
to the Sultan, announced his intention of protecting the new
province. Count Emeric Tekeli, who had ably headed its revolt
since 1678, was invested with the caphtan as hospodar. <span
class="sidenote">Schemes of Leopold.</span>Leopold vainly
endeavoured, by his minister Caprara, to obtain a renewal of
the peace made with the Turks in 1664; but the influence of
France in the divan was too strong for him. He then turned to
the Diet at Ratisbon;<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78"
class="fnanchor">[78]</a> but its counsels were divided, the
western electors being in favour of war with France. His only
hope seemed to be an alliance with Poland, yet his relations with
the king were not cordial, and he had lately refused his offer of
a league. He made the attempt, however, and succeeded beyond his
hopes. John was convinced that the peace which he had concluded
with the Turks was merely temporary. It therefore seemed his
duty to strike at once while he could be sure of an ally. Such
a course was in keeping with his life-long purpose to curb the
Ottoman power. It also agreed well with the hatred which his
queen had conceived against the court of France, and the promise
of an archduchess for his son was not to be despised.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Offers of France to the
king.</span>Louis left no stone unturned to divert him from
his resolution. He tempted him with the provinces of Silesia and
Hungary, to become the property not of the republic but of the
king and his heirs, if he would join him against the Empire;
<span class="sidenote">French conspiracy against him.</span>
and finding him proof against his offers he began a conspiracy
to dethrone him. On the assembling of the next Diet (January
27th, 1683) the heat of parties was tremendous. When Leopold’s
ambassador, the Count of Walstein, and Palaviccini, the Papal
Nuncio, had stated their proposals of alliance, the deputies in
the pay of France put in their protest. Besides placing every
obstacle in the way of public business, they appealed to the
outside public. Pamphlets appeared daily in which the policy of
the king was warmly condemned. The selfish cabinet of Austria,
which had refused to save Poland, was declared her eternal enemy,
and the nobles were warned that the king could not ally himself
with such a court without imbibing its despotic views.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Discovered by the king.</span>The
opposition gathered strength, and the consequences might<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span> have been serious
had not the king fortunately intercepted some letters of the
French ambassador, which disclosed the details of his plot
(March). He read these letters in full Diet, and their contents
excited the utmost indignation. The ambassador boasted that
through Morstyn, the Grand Treasurer, he knew all the secrets of
the cabinet, that he had bought over numbers of the principal
nobles, whose names he gave, and that the nation was so venal
that he felt certain of destroying the league. He added that the
king had rejected all his offers, but that he trusted to make him
powerless. Among the nobles mentioned were Jablonowski, now Grand
General of Poland, and Sapieha, who, since the death of Michael
Paz, had been Grand General of Lithuania. The latter belonged to
a family upon which the king had showered his favours.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">His tact.</span>John used this
information with wonderful tact. He at once declared that the
ambassador, to show his zeal to his master, had evidently
slandered the grandees; Morstyn alone, whose guilt was proved by
a letter in his own hand, deserved the punishment of treason. The
king concluded by saying that he trusted the Diet would help him
to show the French king that the Polish nation was not altogether
venal. The speech was received with shouts of applause, and
the suspected nobles were now foremost in supporting the king.
A similar change took place in the nation, and the French
ambassador found it unsafe to go abroad without an escort. The
Grand Treasurer would have been brought to trial if he had not
escaped to France.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Alliance with the empire.</span>The
immediate result of this discovery was the conclusion of an
alliance, offensive and defensive, with Austria (March 31st).
Leopold bound himself to bring 60,000 men into the field; the
republic was to furnish 40,000. There was an express stipulation
that neither party should apply to the Pope for leave to break
his oaths. The Papal Nuncio procured the addition of a clause,
by which John bound himself to command his troops in person.<a
id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
Leopold in return conceded to him that title of “Majesty” which
he had so long withheld.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Exertions of Sobieski.</span>This
treaty was a serious blow to the policy of Louis XIV.
Forbin-Janson, who soon quitted Poland in disgust, comforted
his master by the assurance that John was far too unwieldy to
take the field. The same idea prevailed throughout Europe, and
especially in the Turkish camp. He was now so stout that he
required aid to mount his horse; but he had not lost one spark
of his youthful fire. His army needed complete reorganisation,
and he spent several hours each day in the field. He did not
neglect measures of policy. He proposed to the Emperor the
extension of the league, and confided to him his favourite
scheme of reviving a republic in Greece. By that means<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span> alone, he
thought, the Turkish empire could be confined within bounds. He
sent an embassy to the Sophy of Persia, but could not persuade
him to declare war against the Porte.<a id="FNanchor_80"
href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> He then tried to
mediate between the Emperor and the insurgents in Hungary, and
succeeded so far as to obtain a promise from Tekeli that Moravia
should be left untouched.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81"
class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Finally he tried to promote a good
understanding between France and Austria, but Louis sullenly
refused his mediation.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Vizier’s forces.</span>The
preparations of the Grand Vizier were now complete, and in
the spring he advanced his vast host to Essek, in Hungary.
He had under his standards at least 300,000 combatants<a
id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
and 300 pieces of artillery. He was accompanied by Selim
Gieray, the terrible Tartar khan, and by a crowd of his nomad
horsemen.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Rapid advance of the Turks upon
Vienna.</span>The Emperor could scarcely realize the
peril in which he stood. He reckoned that his frontier
fortresses would detain the Turks for at least two campaigns.
Fortunately Sobieski, by means of a letter which his Cossack
spies intercepted<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83"
class="fnanchor">[83]</a> in Bulgaria, was enabled to assure him
that Vienna would be the first point of attack. This intelligence
was soon put beyond a doubt. The Duke of Lorraine, general of
the Imperial forces, who with scarcely 30,000 men was covering
Upper Hungary, was compelled to retreat. The whole Turkish army
continued to advance by forced marches, leaving the fortresses in
their rear; and Lorraine had barely time to throw 8,000 infantry
into Vienna and retreat beyond the Danube, before 50,000 Tartars,
the advanced guard of Mustapha, appeared at the gates (July
9). Leopold had profited by Sobieski’s warning to demolish the
extensive suburbs where the nobility resided, but the city was
wholly unprepared for defence.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Panic at Vienna.</span>The night
before Lorraine’s arrival the Emperor himself with his court
fled precipitately to Linz, and thence to Passau. The peasants
of the southern plain were flocking into the city by hundreds,
while many of the citizens followed the Emperor in his flight.
<span class="sidenote">Measures for defence.</span>It was left
to Lorraine, with the governor, the intrepid Count Stahremberg,
to concert measures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]
</span> of resistance. The fortifications were hastily
repaired, and the counterscarp protected by thick palisades, but
it was doubtful whether they could stand an assault, owing to the
neglect of a long security. A body of 5,000 citizens was formed
to assist the garrison, which did not amount to 14,000 men. A
week later (July 14) the Grand Vizier occupied the plain, and
opened the trenches before the city.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Terror of Europe.</span>Meanwhile all
Europe, and especially Italy, was seized with consternation
at the rapid march of the Turks. The plans of the King of
France, who had advanced his army to the Rhine, were somewhat
disconcerted. Finding himself pointed at as the cause of the
invasion of Christendom,<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84"
class="fnanchor">[84]</a> he made a show of magnanimity, and
suspended his threatened blow. It is even said that he offered
the Emperor a contingent of 80,000 men, which was rejected with
becoming scorn; but the statement seems improbable.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sobieski urged to hasten his
march.</span>The Pope sent pressing messages to Sobieski to
bring his succours before it was too late. The Emperor also,
writing with unwonted deference, begged him to place himself at
the head of the Imperial troops. “However inferior we are in
number,” he says, “your name alone, so terrible to the enemy,
will ensure a victory.” He added that his troops were waiting at
Tuln, fifteen miles north-west of Vienna, and that at that point
a bridge had been constructed over the Danube.<a id="FNanchor_85"
href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Lorraine,
generously forgetting their old rivalry for the crown of Poland,
wrote that he should be proud to serve under such an hero. His
own skill had given some hope to a declining cause. Assisted
by some Polish cavalry, he had captured the bridge of Presburg
from Tekeli, but his force was too small to do any damage to the
besiegers.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Siege of Vienna.</span>It is indeed a
marvel that Vienna did not fall almost at once. Within a week
of the opening of the trenches, the besiegers had reached the
palisade of the counterscarp, and, as cannon could not be used
for its defence, many of the garrison lost their lives in a
hand-to-hand combat. On the 7th of August the counterscarp was
captured after an engagement in which both sides suffered great
loss. The besieged especially lost many officers, and the brave
governor was seriously wounded. From this time forward the
city must have succumbed if the Vizier had ordered a general
assault. Mustapha knew this, but he imagined that the booty
would be enormous, and he did not wish it to fall into the hands
of his soldiers. He had pitched his<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_51">[51]</span> vast pavilion in the gardens
of the Emperor’s palace, called the Favourite, and here he
passed his days in the pursuit of pleasure. His miners advanced
steadily, but in other respects he was inactive.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Measures of Sobieski.</span>At
the first news of the danger of Vienna Sobieski hastened to
Cracow, where his army was assembling. His hussars answered his
summons with alacrity, but the Lithuanians were slow to take
the field. He had no intention of waiting for them, although
the troops under his orders were scarcely half the complement
of 40,000. He sorely needed funds for their equipment; but
as the Papal subsidies had not arrived,<a id="FNanchor_86"
href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> he gave lavishly
from his private treasury. He had not intended to take his
Turkish body-guard; but they begged leave to accompany him, and

<p><span class="sidenote">His rapid march to the Danube.</span>On
the 15th of August he quitted Cracow, accompanied by his son
James, and having reviewed his troops at Tarnowitz, in Silesia
(August 18), pushed on for the Danube. Leaving his main body
at the head of 2,000 horse, he traversed like a whirlwind the
plains of Moravia, and arrived at Tuln on the 2nd of September.
The prince who was reported too infirm to take the field, had
covered on horseback 350 miles in little more than ten days.
Finding the bridge unfinished and scarcely half the Imperial
forces assembled, he could not restrain his impatience. “Does
the Emperor take me for an adventurer?” he exclaimed angrily. “I
have left my army to command his. It is not for myself, but for
him I fight.” Three days later (September 5th) the Polish army
under Jablonowski appeared, and soon afterwards the succours from
Bavaria and Saxony.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Forces of the allies.</span>Before the
king’s arrival there had been divisions of opinion among the
imperial generals; now all men cheerfully obeyed his orders. The
whole force amounted to 70,000 men, of whom 21,000 were from
Austria, 18,000 from Poland, and 31,000 from Bavaria, Saxony,
and the Circles. Of these at least 38,000 were cavalry. John
had never commanded an army of nearly this strength, and he was
confident of success. He bade the Imperialists consider not the
vast numbers of the enemy but the incapacity of their general.
“Would any of you,” he asked, “have suffered the construction
of this bridge within five leagues of your camp? The man cannot
<em>fail</em> to be beaten.”</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Exertions of the king.</span>In
his letters to the queen, which have most fortunately
been preserved,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88"
class="fnanchor">[88]</a> we can follow the inmost thoughts
of the great commander during these most anxious days. He
twice remarks with evident pleasure that the German troops
obey him better than his own. At the same time he is<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span> disgusted with
the trifling squabbles over etiquette which occupy so much of his
time. Even his necessary duties allow him no leisure. “Continual
harangues, my interviews with the Duke of Lorraine and the other
chiefs, innumerable orders to be given, prevent me not only from
writing, but from taking food and rest.”<a id="FNanchor_89"
href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Yet his
unreasonable consort, for whom his devoted fondness appears
in almost every line,<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90"
class="fnanchor">[90]</a> complains that he does not read her
letters. “I must complain of you, my dear, my incomparable
Mariette.... Can you say seriously that I do not read your
letters? The fact is that I read each of them three times at
least; first, when they arrive, secondly, as I go to bed, when
at last I am free, and, thirdly, when I set myself to answer
them.... If sometimes I fail to write at length, can you not
explain my haste without the help of injurious suppositions? The
armies of two continents are but a few miles from each other.
I must think of everything; I must provide for the smallest
detail.”</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Passage of the Danube.</span>On the
6th of September the army crossed the Danube. The splendid
equipment of the king’s hussars attracted universal admiration;
and his ill-clad infantry looked especially mean by contrast.
His officers entreated him to allow it to cross by night, but he
would not consent. Whilst one of the worst regiments was passing
over, “Look at this well,” he cried to the spectators; “it is an
invincible body which has sworn never to be clothed but with the
spoils of the enemy.” At these words the men, who had hung their
heads in shame, marched on erect with cheerful confidence. During
the crossing of the bridge a note arrived from Stahremberg with
the simple words, “No more time to lose.” The miners were already
under the Emperor’s city palace, and numbers of the garrison were
dying of dysentery.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Ascent of the Kahlemberg.</span>John
called a council of war to decide the route which should be
taken. Between him and Vienna rose the lofty ridge called the
Kahlemberg; and it was necessary either to go round it by the
main road, which was flanked by the Turkish cannon, or to climb
direct to the summit. John chose the latter route; but it proved
more difficult than he had supposed. Three days were consumed in
the ascent. All the heavy baggage had to be left behind, and of
the artillery only the Polish light guns could be dragged up. At
length, on the evening of the 11th, the Polish hussars lighted
their fires among the woods which crowned the heights, and were
answered by joyful signals from the cathedral of St. Stephen.
<span class="sidenote">Apprehension of the Turks.</span>The
Turks were struck with consternation.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_53">[53]</span> The Grand Vizier, though he
had certain intelligence of the ascent,<a id="FNanchor_91"
href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> neglected to oppose
it, partly because he despised the Christian army, and partly
because he wished to take Vienna before their eyes. But he could
not inspire his troops with his own braggart assurance. During
the night John’s prisoners, whom he had set free by design, came
into the camp and spread the news that the king of Poland was
commanding in person. Mustapha loudly expressed his disbelief;
but he could not prevent the spread of a panic. At break of day
he determined to lead the janissaries to a general assault, while
he detached the spahis and auxiliaries to confront the relieving
force.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Confidence of Sobieski.</span>From
the castle of Leopoldsberg about sunset Sobieski surveyed the
scene with mixed feelings. He saw that he would have to make
his advance over most precipitous and difficult ground; but his
experienced eye was not dismayed either by the imposing array
of the Turkish tents or by the multitude of their occupants.
Writing to the queen the same night he shows his old confidence:
“Humanly speaking, and while putting all our hope in God, one
must believe that a general, who has not thought of concentrating
or entrenching himself, but is encamped as if we were a hundred
miles off, is predestined to be beaten.” He complains, however,
that he had not been warned of the steepness of the descent, and
must change his order of battle. During the night the noise of
the Turkish cannon was such that “we could not close an eye,” and
the wind was so high that “it seemed as if the Vizier, who is
reputed a magician, had unchained against us the powers of the
air.”</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Advance of the allies.</span>When day
dawned on Sunday, the memorable 12th of September, the wind fell,
and the heat was most severe. John attended mass with the Duke
of Lorraine in the old church of Leopoldsberg, and received the
sacrament. <span class="sidenote">Their order of battle.</span>He
then mounted his horse, and ordered the advance. The right wing
was occupied by the Poles, under Jablonowski; the centre by the
Germans, under the Prince of Waldeck; the left wing by the
Imperial troops, under the Duke of Lorraine.<a id="FNanchor_92"
href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> The king directed
the whole; but his post was in the right wing.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Battle of Vienna.</span>The ground
in their front was broken by gullies and rough eminences, and
here and there by rude parapets of earth, which served as
the boundaries of the vineyards. The Turks in vain attempted
to defend these positions; they were driven from point to
point by the impetuous hussars, and the Polish artillery,
dexterously handled by Konski, did such<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_54">[54]</span> execution that by midday the army
had reached the plain. After an interval of rest the advance was
continued, and the villages of Nussdorf and Heligenstadt were
carried by the hussars at the lance’s point, not without some
loss. At five o’clock the order was given for a halt, and John
proposed to rest his wearied troops before the final struggle.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Vizier, who had been gallantly repulsed by the
besieged, had hastened to check the retreat of the Turks. He saw
with uneasiness the horse-tails on the Polish lances, and feared
that after all the king might be present. At a conspicuous point
in the lines he caused the hoisting of a red pavilion, which was
surmounted by the standard of the Prophet, and tried to raise the
spirits of his troops by his own cool assurance. Seating himself
under its shade with his two sons and the Tartar khan he ordered
coffee to be served.</p>

<p>The Polish cavalry had advanced so near that John could
detect these movements with his field-glass. Provoked at this
ostentatious contempt, he bade his artillerymen aim exclusively
at the red pavilion, and offered fifty crowns for each successful
volley. He also detached a body of hussars to seize a position
from which they could fire with more effect. The cavalry dashed
forward with the cry of “Sobieski for ever,” and drove the Turks
headlong from the spot. “By Allah,” exclaimed the Tartar khan, as
he heard their shouts, “the king is really among them.” The Turks
had also heard the dreaded name; and all at once a terrible panic
arose throughout the camp.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93"
class="fnanchor">[93]</a> “They are defeated,” cried Sobieski,
as he saw them waver, and ordering a general advance, he put
himself at the head of the Poles with the words, “Non nobis,
non nobis, Domine exercituum, sed nomini tuo da gloriam!” <span
class="sidenote">Rout of the Turks.</span>The shock of the charge
was tremendous, and none but the spahis resisted it. These brave
horsemen, surrounded by the rout, stood their ground, but were
cut in pieces. The Vizier, weeping like a child, besought the
Khan to save him. “I know the King of Poland,” answered Selim;
“I told you that we should have to make way before him.”<a
id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
Joining in the flight they effected their escape, although the
Vizier was almost captured.</p>

<p>Night had now come on, and John was anxious to secure the
camp in case the enemy should return. He therefore discouraged
the pursuit, and forbade pillage on pain of death. <span
class="sidenote">The Vizier’s quarters.</span>He passed the
night, like his soldiers, in the open air, although he took
possession of the Vizier’s quarters. In the morning he inspected
this vast bazaar of Eastern luxury, which he describes as
occupying a space “as large as Warsaw or Leopol.” Mustapha
had come, in fact, prepared for a triumph. He is said<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span> to have contemplated
creating an empire by making himself emperor of the French.
He had brought every requirement for making Vienna a Turkish
arsenal, and had not omitted the materials for his mosques.<a
id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
Writing to the queen on September 13th, the king says: “The
Vizier has taken nothing but his horse and the clothes on his
back. He has left me his heir.... His jewels alone are worth some
thousands of ducats.... You cannot say to me, my heart, as the
Tartar women often say to their husbands, ‘You are not a man,
for you have brought me no booty.’... The town could not have
held out more than five days. The imperial palace is riddled
with bullets; those immense bastions, split in pieces and half
falling, look terrible.”</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Losses of the two armies.</span>The
losses of the two armies in the action have been variously
stated. Talenti, whom John sent to the Pope with what was
believed to be the standard of the Prophet, informed his Holiness
that at least 40,000 Turks had perished.<a id="FNanchor_96"
href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Voltaire, with
as little truth, states the number at 600.<a id="FNanchor_97"
href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> It is evident
from the letters of the king, which speak of the slain as
making the neighbourhood unhealthy, that nearly 10,000 must
have been slain.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98"
class="fnanchor">[98]</a> The loss of the Poles alone was
estimated at more than 1,000, and the allies probably lost in
proportion.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Entry of Sobieski into
Vienna.</span>About midday the king entered Vienna through
the breach. He was received with acclamations. Multitudes
thronged his horse, and in spite of the frowns of their superiors
openly compared him with their fugitive monarch. He entered the
church of the Augustine Friars, and, as there was no priest at
hand, he himself chanted the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</i>. Passing on to the
cathedral of St. Stephen, he remained long prostrate before the
altar, while the same ceremony was performed with greater pomp.
Then a discourse was preached to the assembled crowds from the
text—“There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.” On
leaving the building, he could scarcely pass through the masses
of men who pressed upon him, and begged to kiss his victorious
hands. Afterwards he dined in public with Count Stahremberg, and
then returned to his quarters, declaring with truth that this was
the happiest day of his life.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Joy of all Europe, excepting the French
king.</span>He took an almost malicious pleasure in writing
at once to inform Louis XIV. of his success. He told him that
he felt it his particular duty to report to the most Christian
king “the victory which had been gained, and the safety of
Christianity.” So disgusted was Louis at the collapse of his
plans that he could not trust himself to answer the letter.
The French civil journals, in noticing the raising<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span> of the siege,
speak slightingly of the King of Poland, and try to attribute
all the credit to the Count of Stahremberg.<a id="FNanchor_99"
href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> But no one was
deceived by these manœuvres. All Europe resounded with the
praises of Sobieski. From every Catholic pulpit he was eulogised
as the bravest defender of the Church. Filicaia and other
Italian poets sang of his glory in rapturous strains. Innocent
XI. received his envoys with the highest honours, and ordered
the standard of the Prophet to be borne in triumph throughout
Italy. Queen Christina, who was then resident at Rome, after
complimenting the Pope, wrote Sobieski a remarkable letter,
in which she declared that she now felt for the first time
the passion of envy; she calls him emphatically the greatest
king in the world, and displays by other insinuations her
hatred for Louis XIV.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100"
class="fnanchor">[100]</a> <span class="sidenote">Ingratitude
of Leopold.</span>It is painful to relate the conduct of the
Emperor. He, who should have been the first to thank and
congratulate his deliverer, was in no hurry to meet him face to
face. Entering the city on the 14th, he contrasted with anger
the coolness of his reception with the enthusiasm shown to the
King of Poland; and it was only when he heard that John was about
to continue the pursuit that he was prevailed on to consent to
the interview. His punctilious scruples as to his demeanour
towards an elective sovereign disgusted his German allies, and
the Duke of Lorraine declared that he ought to receive the king
with open arms. At length it was agreed, on the proposition of
Sobieski, that they should meet on horseback a few paces in
front of the Polish army. <span class="sidenote">His interview
with Sobieski.</span>Let us hear the king’s own account to the
queen. “I will not draw you the portrait of the Emperor, for he
is well known. He was mounted on a bay horse of Spanish breed;
he had a close coat richly embroidered, a French hat with a
clasp and white and red feathers, a belt mounted with sapphires
and diamonds, and a sword to match. We saluted each other with
politeness; I made him my compliments in a few words of Latin;
he answered in the same tongue in choice terms. Being thus face
to face I presented my son, who approached and saluted him. The
Emperor merely raised his hand to his hat; I was astounded at
it. He did the same with the senators and generals, and even
with his connection, the Palatine of Beltz.<a id="FNanchor_101"
href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> To avoid the
scandal and the carping of the public, I addressed a few<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span> more words to
the Emperor; after which I turned my horse, we saluted each
other, and I rode back to the camp.” John here evidently conceals
as far as possible the chagrin he felt at the awkward silence
of the Emperor, and his distance towards Prince James, his
prospective son-in-law. Another account says that he sternly
reproved a Palatine, who advanced to kiss the Emperor’s foot,
and that he said significantly as he turned away, “Brother, I am
glad to have done you this small service.”<a id="FNanchor_102"
href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> After the Grand
General had shown him the Polish troops, the Emperor returned to
Vienna; and two days later sent a jewelled sword to Prince James,
and explained that his grateful emotions had deprived him of the
power of speech.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Shameful treatment of the
Poles.</span>But the Emperor’s ingratitude did not stop here.
A day or two after the battle, the Poles (like the French after
the battle of St. Gothard) found it difficult to obtain forage
or provisions, and they were not allowed to bury even their
most illustrious dead in the cemeteries of the city. The king
notices bitterly that, since the arrival of the Emperor, everyone
shunned them as if they had the plague.<a id="FNanchor_103"
href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> The Poles were
furious at this studied neglect, and besought John to lead
them back at once to Poland. “Our subalterns regret that we
have succoured the Emperor; they wish now that the proud race
had perished beyond hope of resurrection.”<a id="FNanchor_104"
href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>So seldom had the army served beyond the frontiers, that its
discipline, never strictly enforced, was now scarcely regarded;
and numbers left the ranks and took the nearest road to their
homes. John sympathised with his soldiers, but he had the ardour
of a crusading hero, and he felt himself bound by his oath to
pursue the infidel, and “strike a second decisive blow.”<a
id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
<span class="sidenote">John’s anxiety to follow up the
victory.</span>His letter of the 13th of September to the Marquis
of Grana, shows the high hopes with which his glorious victory
had inspired him. He expresses his belief that the time had
come for the collapse of the Sultan’s power, and urges that
further successes in Hungary might produce revolts in the
heart of his empire.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106"
class="fnanchor">[106]</a> John has been most unjustly accused
of finding a Capua in the Vizier’s tents.<a id="FNanchor_107"
href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> The fact is,
that during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
the whole of the campaign, the Poles were in the van. The king
was disgusted at the backwardness of the imperial court, though
his high and simple nature failed to discern its motive. “It
is enough to make one die a thousand times a day,” he says,
“to see so many opportunities slip away.”<a id="FNanchor_108"
href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Suspicions of the Emperor.</span>The
fact was that Leopold shrank from sending his victorious
neighbour into a rebellious province of his empire. Yet he
dared not stop him. His suspicions were increased when John
received overtures from Tekeli, the Hungarian leader, and
attempted to intercede for him. The Emperor’s coldness had so
far alienated his German allies, that the Elector of Saxony
withdrew his troops, and the Elector of Bavaria threatened to do
the same. He did nothing to recognise the services of the Duke
of Lorraine. He coveted the spoil, and even had the assurance
to suggest, through his head groom, that John should present
him with some of the Vizier’s horses. The gift was made and
received as a due. The king also made such handsome presents
to many of the German princes, that he gaily tells the queen
she will have to be content with the buffaloes and camels.<a
id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
His general distrust of the Austrians was such that he deposited
his part of the spoil with the Jesuits.<a id="FNanchor_110"
href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">John advances into Hungary.</span>At
length (September 17), weary of waiting for the Imperial
troops, he started for the Danube. His design was to attack
Lower Hungary, which had been a Turkish province for a hundred
and fifty years, and to invest Buda, its capital. Thither the
Vizier had retired to rally the remains of his army, and was
avenging his defeat by the execution of a crowd of pachas. The
Turks could hardly believe that the Christians would retaliate
at once by invading their territory, and Sobieski’s advance
created the utmost alarm. But he was unhappily delayed at
Presburg by a fever<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111"
class="fnanchor">[111]</a> which attacked his troops and produced
such distress as to shake his resolution to proceed. <span
class="sidenote">Intrigues of the queen.</span>Another cause of
his chagrin was the scarcely concealed intriguing of the queen
among the troops to force him to return. She tried to persuade
him that she was in constant fear of the troops of Tekeli. In
two admirable letters<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112"
class="fnanchor">[112]</a> he tells her the powerful motives
which induce him to continue the campaign. He shows her that
the Poles are crushing their national enemy without the cost
of one sou to the republic, and declares that, since the
Christian armies have elected him their generalissimo, he will
remain even if his countrymen desert him to finish the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span> campaign. “I have
devoted my life,” he says, “to the glory of God and to this holy
cause, and to that I will adhere.”</p>

<p>After a few days his troops were able to resume their march,
and they were joined by the Imperialists on the 2nd of October.
They crossed the second arm of the Danube, and followed its
course on the left bank. The first Turkish fortress in their
way was Strigonia, called by the Hungarians Gran, a place of
great strength on the right bank, communicating by a bridge
with the fortified suburb of Parkan on the opposite side. The
vanguard of the Polish cavalry, always a march in advance of
the infantry and the Imperialists, had descended the hills to
reconnoitre this fort, when suddenly a large Turkish force issued
from the works and appeared in their front (October 7th.) <span
class="sidenote">He is defeated at Parkan.</span>Before the Poles
could form in line they had to sustain a tremendous charge, and
were put to flight. The king, who was close behind with the main
body, could not rally the fugitives, and found himself obliged,
with his 4,000 hussars, to charge the enemy in his turn. His
onset was unsuccessful. The Turks opened their lines to enclose
the Poles, and this caused a panic which ended in a rout. The
king and his personal escort strove in vain to stem the rush
of the Turks; they were swept along in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</i>. The
pursuit was hot; and the king, who was one of the last to turn
his horse, was in great danger. A spahi raised his scimitar to
strike him, but was hewn down before his blow fell. John was
hurried along breathless, scarcely able to hold the reins, and
jostled by the mad haste of his flying troops. At length the
Imperialists appeared, and the Turks desisted from the pursuit.
The king lay down upon a bundle of hay, sorely bruised, but more
afflicted in mind than in body. It was the first defeat he had
sustained, and it was embittered at first by the supposed loss
of his son, who however escaped unwounded. When the Austrians
came up, with sorrow in their faces and joy at their hearts, he
raised himself with dignity, and said, “Gentlemen, I have been
well beaten, but I will take my revenge <em>with</em> you and
<em>for</em> you.” His Cossack infantry, who heard that he had
perished, bewailed him as a father; and he was deeply touched
by their devotion.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113"
class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Several historians have asserted
that he brought on this engagement in order to crown himself
with glory before the arrival of his allies; but his letter
to the queen after the battle shows beyond a doubt that his
cavalry had orders not to fight, and that the vanguard were
taken unawares.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114"
class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>The Poles hastily buried their dead in order to
conceal their losses, and were so dispirited that the
king could scarcely persuade them to wipe out the defeat.
<span class="sidenote">Great victory of Sobieski at
Parkan.</span>Although three days after he says<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span> that his body is
“as black as a coal,”<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115"
class="fnanchor">[115]</a> his exertions were unremitting to
prepare his army for a grand attack. The Turks, as he had
expected, were elated at their victory. A report spread widely
among them, which even reached the European courts, that the
hero had been slain; and they took a fresh lease of courage.
The Vizier sent them reinforcements; and when, two days later
(October 9th), the Christian army defiled into the plain of
Parkan, they found a large force drawn up to receive them. The
same morning the Turks commenced the attack, and repeatedly
charged the left wing commanded by Jablonowski. They were beaten
back with splendid courage; the steady advance of the king
with the right wing upon the fort of Parkan threw them into
confusion; and when the Christians charged in their turn, the
Turks gave way on all sides. <span class="sidenote">Storming
of the fort.</span>The fort was taken by storm, and no
quarter was given;<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116"
class="fnanchor">[116]</a> numbers of fugitives were drowned in
the Danube; several pachas were captured, and at least 40,000
Turks perished.</p>

<p>Writing to the queen on the following day, John speaks
of the victory as “even greater than that of Vienna.” <span
class="sidenote">Flight of the Vizier.</span>The Vizier was
seized with dismay, and fled precipitately to Belgrade. His
flight enabled the king to exclaim with pride that now at last,
after two hundred years of slavery, Hungary was delivered from
the infidel. He adds, “This has surpassed my expectation, and
I believe that of my contemporaries.”<a id="FNanchor_117"
href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Capture of Strigonia.</span>John was
anxious at once to lay siege to Buda, which he regarded as the
goal of the campaign, but the Duke of Lorraine persuaded him to
begin with Strigonia. This was one of the strongest fortresses
in Hungary, and had been occupied by the Turks for a hundred and
forty years. Yet the place surrendered in a fortnight, although
the garrison was composed of 5,000 janissaries. Well might the
Turkish pachas exclaim to the Poles that their king was raised
up by God to be the scourge of Islam.<a id="FNanchor_118"
href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>John could now no longer resist the eagerness of his nobles
to return to Poland. <span class="sidenote">Return of the
Poles.</span>Early in November the armies separated, and the
Poles retraced their steps through Hungary. Before their
departure the king had endeavoured to mediate between Tekeli
and the commissioners of the Emperor, but the sole favour which
he could obtain for the insurgents was<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_61">[61]</span> the promise of a general amnesty, and
his disinterested efforts only resulted in increasing Leopold’s
suspicions of his motive.<span class="sidenote">His efforts on
behalf of the Hungarians.</span> Yet he could not give up the
attempt; he longed to establish the strong barrier of a free
people against the Turkish advance; and as a last resource he
begged for the help of the Holy See. In his instructions to
his minister at Rome,<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119"
class="fnanchor">[119]</a> he claims this favour from the
Imperial Court as his due, and indignantly disowns the unworthy
motives imputed to him. “The sole interest of his Sacred Majesty
is to rally the nations against the pagans. For that end he
demands that the nation which he has re-conquered for Christendom
should be treated after a Christian fashion.” But the Pope was
so closely bound to the policy of Leopold that he cared not to
interfere; and nothing was done to restore the ancient liberties
of Hungary. John was deeply indignant, but his conscience would
not permit him to insist on this concession as the price of his
sworn alliance.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Their hostility to his army.</span>His
friendly relations with Tekeli were broken off by the rapine of
the Lithuanians, who, on hearing of the spoils of which their
tardiness had deprived them, had set off in haste towards the
south, and were plundering Upper Hungary. The inhabitants,
regarding John as responsible for these reckless freebooters,
and knowing nothing of his efforts in their behalf, shut
themselves up in their towns and treated him as an enemy.
Though he could scarcely obtain provisions for his troops,
he was loth to relinquish his design of quartering them in
Hungary. But the queen had hit on a new method of preventing
him, which was more effective than the murmurs of his men.
She suddenly ceased to answer his letters. “For five weeks,”
he complains, “I really have not known whether there is a
Poland in the world.”<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120"
class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Triumphal entry into Cracow.</span>He
closed the campaign gloriously on the anniversary of Kotzim
(November 11th), by capturing Schetzin after a few hours’ siege,
and then returned home through the Carpathian Mountains. The
ground was frozen so hard that the tents could not be pitched,
and it was Christmas-eve before the victorious army, laden with
the spoils of the East, entered Cracow in triumph. A few days
later the Grand Vizier received with resignation his sentence of
death from the Sultan, and ere long the head which had dreamed of
the conquest of Europe was adorning the gates of the seraglio.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">General results of the
campaign.</span>The result of this grand campaign was to
change the course of history. Hitherto, as at Lepanto and at
St. Gothard, the Ottoman arms had never received more than a
temporary check; from henceforward we find the empire of the
Sultan constantly losing ground in Europe. John Sobieski had
recovered in two months more than had been gained in a<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span> hundred years.
The chief explanation of this decline is doubtless internal
decay; but the glory of the Polish hero consists in the
singleness of aim which enabled him in a moment of supreme danger
to disregard old enmities, and to fly to the defence of Western
Christendom, then too disunited to defend itself.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Advantages to Poland.</span>Poland
gained more by this campaign than she was ready to confess. The
Turks had for ever lost the offensive, and were so much engaged
in their conflict with the Empire, that they could not think of
revenging themselves upon the republic. But they still retained
the fortress of Kaminiec; and until this sore was closed, the
danger seemed ever present. The Cossacks however, from whom that
danger had first arisen, now acknowledged the king’s authority,
and falling upon the Tartars as they returned from Vienna, routed
them with immense slaughter. But the renown procured by the
victories of the king was more advantageous still. Venice and
Muscovy besought the honour of an alliance with Poland; and she
never stood higher among the nations than at this moment.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Campaign of 1684.</span>Civil troubles
prevented John taking the field early the next year (1684).<a
id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
In August, however, he marched into Podolia, and after taking
Jaslowicz, approached the walls of Kaminiec. Since he could not
hope to reduce it by blockade, his only resource was to erect a
fort in the neighbourhood; and this he effected in the face of
the enemy, who dared not risk a battle.</p>

<p>He returned to Zolkiew in November, dissatisfied with the
results of the campaign. <span class="sidenote">Jealousy of
John’s generals.</span>At its outset he had been attended by
numbers of distinguished foreigners, anxious to serve under
so great a prince, but he had found himself enfeebled by the
lukewarm support of his two Grand Generals, Jablonowski and
Sapieha. Both were jealous of his monopolising the glory by
commanding in every campaign; but each of them had ulterior
reasons. Jablonowski was the chief of the faction of Louis XIV.,
who was straining every nerve to gain over Poland; Sapieha
dreamed of separating Lithuania from Poland, and becoming
sovereign of the Grand Duchy. In the ensuing Diet the faction of
each had its complaints against the king. The former blamed him
for his ill-success against Kaminiec; the latter accused him of
depriving Lithuania of her rights by summoning the Diet to meet
at Warsaw instead of at Grodno. The Lithuanians at first refused
to attend it, but they yielded on the king’s proposal that it
should be called the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]
</span> Diet of Grodno. Their opposition to his plans,
however, was relentless, and one of the family of Paz<a
id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
carried his abuse so far as to threaten to make him feel the
weight of his arm. Such was the treatment that was reserved for
the saviour of Europe at the hands of his own subjects!</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Unsuccessful campaign of
1685.</span>His health had now become so feeble that in
the next campaign (1685) he was able to gratify Jablonowski
by leaving him in command. His loss was at once keenly felt.
Skilful though he was, the Grand General allowed his army
to be caught in a defile in the forest of Bucovina, and it
required all his ability to rescue it from utter annihilation.
Ashamed at his own pride no less than at his reverse he shunned
the royal presence.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123"
class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Perfidy of Leopold.</span>The zeal
of the king for the cause of the Emperor was cooled about
this time by the marriage of the archduchess, who had been
promised to Prince James, to the Elector of Bavaria. The queen<a
id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
was impelled by her resentment to join the French party, and
Leopold had too much cause to fear that she would induce
John to make a separate peace. <span class="sidenote">Father
Vota.</span>He therefore sent a Jesuit named Vota as his secret
agent to the court of Warsaw. The mission of the holy father
was not openly political; his journey was supposed to have
been undertaken to convert the heretics of the Greek church;
but the Emperor trusted that his literary and social talents
would procure him an ascendancy over the king of Poland. He is
described as a man of wide knowledge and wonderful powers of
conversation; and his religious habits and unobtrusive demeanour
preserved him from suspicion. He devoted himself to the king’s
pleasure, and often slept on the floor of an ante-chamber in
order to be at hand to entertain his weary hours. He easily kept
him faithful to the league against the infidel, and hinted that
the provinces of Moldavia and Wallachia might, if subdued by
his arms, become hereditary in his family. John knew well that
they would merely become provinces of Poland; but he was anxious
to extend her frontiers to the shores of the Black Sea. <span
class="sidenote">The king tries to revive commerce.</span>In
spite of the opposition of the nobles he wished to revive her
commerce; and a mercantile treaty which he contemplated with
Holland would have been assisted by the acquisition of a double
sea-front.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>

<p><span class="sidenote">Treaty with Muscovy.</span>By a treaty
with Muscovy in this year (1686) he gave up Kiow and Smolensko,
which had been long in her possession, for a large indemnity, and
obtained promises of co-operation in his schemes of conquest.
Posterity has blamed him for these concessions; but in his time
such was the national contempt for the Muscovites that no danger
was apprehended on their side.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Campaign of 1686.</span>His chances of
success were excellent. The Emperor promised his aid on the side
of Hungary; and a great army of Muscovites was to push forward
to the Black Sea. After arranging his plans with the Imperial
generals, John assembled his forces at the Dniester, but he found
all alike, officers and men, indisposed to a campaign beyond the
borders of Poland. But he could not now draw back. He advanced
through the deserts of Moldavia to the Pruth, passing on his
way the fatal spot where Zolkiewski met with a hero’s death.
Descending the river he entered Yassy, the capital, on the 15th
of August, and found that the hospodar had fled with his troops,
but had left provisions for the invading force, thinking by this
means to secure his immunity from punishment, whatever might be
the result of the campaign. After two days of rest John pushed on
towards the Black Sea. But the heat, the scarcity of water, and
the terrible solitude<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125"
class="fnanchor">[125]</a> broke the spirit of his army, and
suddenly the Tartars appeared in his front. News also arrived
that the Turks were within a march of him, and there was no
sign either of Muscovite or Austrian succours. Leopold had
again deceived him, and had profited by John’s demonstration to
capture the city of Buda. There was nothing left but to retreat,
and this the king successfully accomplished, through a most
difficult country, in the face of the enemy. The Tartars poisoned
the rivers and springs, and set fire to the vegetation, while
searching clouds of dust and ashes distressed the retiring Poles.
At length they reached the frontiers of Poland; and the only
person who had reaped any benefit from their sufferings was the
Emperor Leopold.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Deposition of the Sultan.</span>In
the following year a revolution at Constantinople, provoked by
continued disasters, deprived Mahomet IV. of his throne; and had
there been a complete accord between the members of the Christian
league, the Ottoman empire might have tottered to its fall. No
soldier of the Church had laboured more steadily towards this end
than John Sobieski; and if it was not realised, the fault lay not
with him but with his more powerful allies.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Polish anarchy.</span>As his
reign drew near its close, the internal disorders of his
kingdom increased. The Emperor never ceased to intrigue with
the Lithuanian grandees against his faithful ally, and the
French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
party opposed him for this fidelity to the league. The lesser
nobility was devoted to him; but the Senate was now the hotbed
of faction. All the grandees wished for the end of his reign,
the French party because they disliked his policy, and the
Lithuanians because they hated his person. Besides this, every
ambitious senator looked to an interregnum as a means of
realising his dreams of power.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Diet of Grodno.</span>In the Diet of
Grodno in 1688 the king was assailed on all sides. The senators<a
id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
in the pay of France clamoured for peace with the Porte; the
Lithuanians, at a hint from the Emperor, accused him of personal
aims in his attempt upon Moldavia. Before any subsidy could be
voted the Diet was dissolved by the veto; and when the king
assembled a convocation he met with the same stormy opposition.
Hastily dismissing the assembly, he submitted to a period of
inaction; but he had the consolation of finding, on a visit to
Wilna in the same year, that even in the Grand Duchy he was
regarded by the people with admiration.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">John refuses peace with the
Turks.</span>A fresh outburst from the French party occurred
in the same summer, when he refused to make peace with the
Sultan, although he was offered the restoration of Kaminiec. He
had bound himself by oath never to make a separate peace without
the consent of his allies; but to keep strictly to this article
was detrimental to the republic, so sorely in need of reforms,
and he had abundant excuse for breaking it in the conduct of the
Emperor.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Tries to establish hereditary
succession.</span>His scruples were not suggested by a desire
for further glory, or by a blindness to the true interests of
Poland. His days of warfare were past for ever. He saw only too
clearly the failure of the old constitution, and he was anxious
before his death to witness the establishment of hereditary
monarchy. In striving to have his son declared his successor
he was not actuated by merely selfish motives, for when a
subject he had held the same principles.<a id="FNanchor_127"
href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> But the grandees
considered such a proposal as a direct infringement of their
privileges; and they were encouraged by Leopold, who found it his
interest to preserve Poland in a state of fermentation.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Affecting scene in the
senate.</span>The king intended to ask this of the republic
at the Diet of Grodno; but his intention becoming known, he was
assailed with the utmost virulence in the senate. The Grand
Treasurer termed him despot, tyrant, and destructor of the public
liberty; a palatine spoke of him as the enemy of his country.
At length the king rose and addressed the senate. He recalled
the patriotism and services of his ancestors, and protested his
devotion to the cause of liberty. But he begged his hearers
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span> pause,
and reflect on the consequences of intestine strife. “Oh, what
will be one day the sad surprise of posterity to see that at
the summit of our glory, when the name of Poland was filling
the universe, we have allowed our country to fall in ruins, to
fall, alas! for ever! For myself I have now and then gained you a
few battles; but I confess myself deprived of all power to save
you. It only remains for me to resign, not to destiny, for I am
a Christian, but to the great and mighty God, the future of my
beloved country.... I seem to hear already resounding over our
heads the cry of the prophet: ‘Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall
be destroyed.’ Your most illustrious Dominations know that I do
not believe in auguries. I do not search out oracles; I give
no credence to dreams; it is not an oracle, it is faith which
teaches me that the decrees of Providence cannot fail to be
accomplished.”</p>

<p>During this prophetic speech the voice of the old king
trembled with emotion, and the senate was deeply touched. The
primate knelt at the foot of the throne, and assured him of the
loyalty of Poland; and a cry of assent arose from all present.
The subsidies were voted by acclamation; but it was only a
transient gleam of concord. <span class="sidenote">Continued
disturbances.</span>Next year there were rumours of a conspiracy
to dethrone the king; and amid the storms of the Diet a bishop
named Opalinski said to him haughtily, “Be equitable, or cease
to reign!” The insult was soon followed by an apology; but
the tumult continued in the assembly, and sabres were freely
used before the veto terminated the disgraceful scene.<a
id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
<span class="sidenote">Intended abdication of Sobieski.</span>The
king felt himself unable to cope with these terrible disorders,
and he instructed his chancellor to prepare an act of abdication
(1689); but the unfeigned sorrow of all classes persuaded him
to withdraw it. There was little improvement, however, in the
temper of future Diets; and the veto was employed as freely as
before.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Discord in his family.</span>John
was not more happy in his domestic than in his public life.
His imperious queen was ever his evil genius. Not content
with diminishing his popularity by mixing too freely in
public affairs,<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129"
class="fnanchor">[129]</a> she sowed dissension round his own
fireside. The king evidently designed for his successor his
eldest son James; for, besides giving him a high command in
the army, he allowed him to sit by his side in the senate. But
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
queen favoured Alexander, her second son, who was more
handsome and popular<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130"
class="fnanchor">[130]</a> than his brother, and her open
partiality produced a fierce hatred between the two brothers.
When the Emperor, reminded of the value of John’s friendship
by the victories of Mustapha Köprili, gave the Princess of
Neuberg in marriage to Prince James<a id="FNanchor_131"
href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> (1690), the queen
took a violent dislike to her daughter-in-law; and the family
breach was widened.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">His last campaign, in 1691.</span>Next
year the king took the field for the last time, nominally to
chastise the Tartars for an invasion in the winter, but really
perhaps to escape the miseries of his court. He took with him
for the first time his son Alexander, and this so exasperated
Prince James that he threatened to leave the country. The king
told him that if he went he would take with him a father’s curse,
and he was persuaded to repent and ask pardon for his violence.
His father said openly that in the ensuing campaign he should
more easily get the better of the enemy than of his own sons. He
gained a victory at Pererita (August 6), and took a few places
in Moldavia, and then returned to his kingdom never to leave it
more.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">His love of retirement.</span>He spent
his last years in retirement, and seldom appeared in public
except in the Diet. His palace of Willanow was his favourite
residence, and from thence in the summer he would roam from
castle to castle, sometimes pitching his tent, like his nomad
forefathers, wherever a picturesque spot or a noble landscape
attracted his fancy. The queen would have preferred the gaieties
of Warsaw; but she followed him into his solitude, and took care
that balls, operas, and the other amusements of a court should be
going on around him.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">His literary tastes.</span>His
chief recreation now, as in his most difficult campaigns, was
the study of the sciences. He complains to the queen, after
the battle of Vienna, that with all his love of reading he
has not had a book in his hand for more than three weeks.<a
id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
When he read he always had a pencil in his hand, and his
marginal notes displayed uncommon powers of mind. Dr. South—no
mean judge—pronounces him to be “very opulently stored with all
polite and scholastical learning.” He was fond of writing Polish
poetry, and when his daughter Theresa married the Elector of
Bavaria he presented her with a copy of verses on the event.<a
id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
Like many others of the Slav race, he was an accomplished
linguist. He could converse with ease in six languages,
including Latin,<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134"
class="fnanchor">[134]</a> and learnt Spanish when he was
past<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
fifty. His delight was to assemble around him cultivated men
like Father Vota, the French Ambassador Cardinal Polignac,
and his physicians, Connor and Jonas, and to “set them very
artfully by the ears”<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135"
class="fnanchor">[135]</a> on some question of philosophy or
natural science.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136"
class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Nor was theology forgotten. He used to
give audiences to the schismatic bishops, and listen patiently to
their arguments for their respective creeds.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Patron of learning.</span>Such a
prince was of course an ardent patron of learning. During his
reign more books issued from the Polish press than in the two
centuries preceding; and his liberal views led him to reprimand
the Catholic clergy for not admitting into their schools the
philosophy of Descartes. <span class="sidenote">Spite of the
nobles.</span>The great nobles, many of them wholly unlettered,
could not sympathise with these literary tastes, and they showed
their spite towards the king in various ways. On one occasion,
when illness kept him away from the Diet, the Sapiehas demanded
that he should be summoned to attend; and when their motion was
lost, they broke up the assembly with the veto. A Jew named
Bethsal, who collected his revenues, was condemned to death by
the Diet on an unproved charge of sacrilege,<a id="FNanchor_137"
href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> and John could
hardly prevail to save his life. <span class="sidenote">Charge of
covetousness unproved.</span>Many imputed his love of retirement
to covetousness, and asserted that he laid up £100,000 a year for
the benefit of his sons.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138"
class="fnanchor">[138]</a> The accusation has been often
repeated, although his life abounds in instances of his
draining his private<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139"
class="fnanchor">[139]</a> coffers to serve a pressing public
need.</p>

<p>The disorders of the kingdom grew more frightful as John
became less able to restrain them. Street brawls between
political parties had always been of common occurrence, but
the rioters now began to use firearms,<a id="FNanchor_140"
href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> and the king had
to publish an edict prohibiting the shedding of blood on pain
of death. He often sent for the chief nobles, and adjured them
by the love of their country to aid him in restoring order.<a
id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
In 1695 the Tartars, tempted by Polish anarchy and by a report
of the king’s death, invaded Russia, and besieged Leopol; but
they disappeared as quickly as they had come on the approach of
Sobieski.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">His feeble health.</span>Reports of
his death were common in Europe, partly from his feeble health
and partly from the interest which many sovereigns<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span> felt
in the event.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142"
class="fnanchor">[142]</a> He had long been afflicted with
dropsy; and a wound in his head, which he had received long
before in the Cossack war, now caused serious alarm.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Schemes of the queen.</span>The queen
was most anxious that he should make his will, and she deputed
her Chancellor, Bishop Zaluski, to make the proposal. The king
received it with disfavour. “I am surprised,” he said, “that a
man of your sense and worth should thus waste your time. Can
you expect anything good of the times in which we live? Look
at the inundation of vice, the contagion of folly; and should
we believe in the execution of our last wishes? In life we
command and are not obeyed. Would it be otherwise in death?”
Soon after the queen entered, and read in the face of the bishop
the failure of her plan. Zaluski tells us that the next day the
king complained bitterly to him of the bodily sufferings brought
on by a dose of mercury which she had given him. His frame was
shaken by convulsive sobs, and he exclaimed wildly, “Will there
be no one to avenge my death?” This was probably only the raving
of a distempered brain; but the queen has never been exempt from
suspicion, and her conduct after his death only served to confirm
it.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">His illness,</span>On the 17th of
June, 1696, his seventy-second birthday,<a id="FNanchor_143"
href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> he lay at
Willanow in a state of dreadful weakness. He asked the news
from Warsaw, and was told that multitudes were flocking to the
churches to pray for his recovery. The intelligence affected
him deeply, and he passed the day in cheerful conversation; but
towards evening he was seized with an attack of apoplexy.<a
id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
The chief officers hastened to his chamber, and when he awoke
to a short interval of consciousness he showed how eager he
was to depart by pronouncing the words “Stava bene.” <span
class="sidenote">And death.</span>Soon afterwards, about sunset,
he breathed his last, and his death, like his birth, was followed
by a sudden and frightful storm.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sorrow of the nation.</span>Only a
few of the nobles welcomed his decease; the mass of the nation
remembered his glory, and sincerely mourned his loss. The
Chancellor Zaluski thus expresses the general sorrow: “With
this Atlas has fallen, in my eyes at least (may I prove a false
prophet!), the republic itself. We seem not so much to have lost
him as to have descended with him into<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_70">[70]</span> the tomb. At least I have but too
much cause to fear that it is all over with our power. At this
news the grief is universal. In the streets men accost each other
with tears, and those who do not weep are yet terrified at the
fate which is in store for us. Terror apart, what grief was ever
more natural? He is, perhaps, the first king in whose reign not
one drop of blood has been shed in reparation of his own wrongs.
He had but one single fault—he was not immortal.”</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Quarrels of his family.</span>Amidst
such heartfelt sorrow the behaviour of his family alienated from
them all public sympathy. Prince James at first refused to admit
the queen with the royal corpse to the castle of Warsaw, and when
at length he yielded, he hurried away to Zolkiew to seize his
father’s treasures. The queen hastened after him to put in her
claim, but he turned the cannon of that fortress against her.
Burning with indignation, she exerted all her influence before
she left the country<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145"
class="fnanchor">[145]</a> to destroy his chances of the crown.
Such was the magic of his father’s name that at first there was
a large party in his favour; but the family quarrels weakened
and dispersed it. The Austrian party elected Augustus of Saxony;
and the French party thought it necessary to protest by seizing
the remains of the late king. The Elector, resolved not to be
out-manœuvred, erected a cenotaph to the memory of John III.; and
it was not till the next reign, thirty-six years later, that his
body received interment.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146"
class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">His sons.</span>The history of his
three sons deserves a word of remark. Charles XII., who as a
boy was a devoted admirer of John Sobieski,<a id="FNanchor_147"
href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> invaded Poland in
1705, and would have offered the crown to Prince James; but the
prince, being then in Germany with his brother Constantine, was
seized by the Saxon troops, and honourably confined at Leipsic;
and, as his brother Alexander nobly refused to profit by his
misfortune, the opportunity passed by. Alexander died at Rome
as a capuchin, and his two brothers resided in Poland on their
estates. James Sobieski had two daughters, of whom the younger,
Maria Clementina, was married to the Chevalier St. George, called
the “Old Pretender,” and became the mother of the unhappy Charles
Edward.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Character of John Sobieski,</span>The
life and exploits of John Sobieski have in modern times scarcely
received their due meed of attention. Born in a country half
civilized, half barbarous, whose independence has now been
completely effaced, his glory has not proved so enduring as
that of less remarkable men who have<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_71">[71]</span> figured on a more conspicuous stage.
As general, as patriot, and as Christian hero, he will
bear comparison with the greatest names in any age. <span
class="sidenote">As general.</span>No man ever won so many
battles in the most desperate situations; no man ever achieved
such deeds with forces often insignificant and always unruly. His
fertility of resource was amazing; yet it was only equal to the
swiftness of his execution. His chief glory is that, unlike any
other great conqueror, his grandest triumphs were obtained in
defensive warfare, and that all his efforts were directed either
to the salvation of his country or to the honour of his religion.
<span class="sidenote">As patriot.</span>His individual greatness
appears most striking in the ascendancy which he early acquired
in his own country. His frank and simple bearing, his noble mien,
and his stirring eloquence, enabled him, while he was still a
subject, to sway the minds and wills of his fellow-countrymen as
if by an irresistible charm.<span class="sidenote">As Christian
hero.</span> He laboured for the safety of Poland with a perfect
singleness of aim; and when that was fully secured, he strove
with a like fixity of purpose for the destruction of the Ottoman
power. To us his crusading ardour may seem to have been out of
date, but we must remember that in the seventeenth century the
Turks still inspired a lively alarm, and that if at the present
day we regard them with pity or contempt, the first step towards
this change was accomplished by the sword of John Sobieski.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">As king.</span>As a king, he is not
entitled to the same high praise. In a land of peace and order
he might have ranked as a benefactor to his people, but in the
home of licence and anarchy his temper was too gentle and refined
to employ the severity which was needed. A king of Poland, if
he was to heal the disorders of his realm, must first have made
himself feared; the natural temperament of Sobieski made him
prefer to be loved. Clemency and generous forgiveness were parts
of his disposition;<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148"
class="fnanchor">[148]</a> and the necessary result upon his
policy was that he resigned himself too easily to bear the
vexations which surrounded him. When he did act, his method was
most unwise; for in his principal attempt at reform—when he aimed
at establishing hereditary succession—he exposed himself to the
charge of a grasping self-interest.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">As head of his family.</span>But we
cannot acquit him of deplorable weakness in the management of
his own family. A hasty passion had thrown him into the power of
an unscrupulous and despotic woman, and his uxorious fondness
left her only too much scope for the activity of her caprice.
We have seen more than once that he could oppose her when his
duty seemed clearly marked out for him; but, for the sake of his
own peace, he allowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]
</span> her to intermeddle without ceasing in the affairs
of Poland. The only result of his indulgence was that very
misery in his domestic circle which he had sought to avoid. Of
the charge against him of avarice we have already spoken. His
chivalrous enthusiasm and cultivated intelligence would have gone
far to disprove it, even if the treasure which he left behind him
had not been found to be only moderate.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">His great services,</span>His services
to his country were extraordinary, although he himself confessed
that he could not arrest her fall. He found her at the opening
of his career plunged in civil strife and beset with foreign
enemies; he left her at its close with peace fully assured to
her, and with her glory at its zenith. Within two years of his
death the peace of Carlowitz was signed with the Turks, by which
they renounced all claim to Kaminiec, Podolia, and the Ukraine.
The fruit of his victories was thus fully reaped; but his efforts
to revive commerce and to form an infantry among the serfs, which
would have been the first step to their emancipation, were never
afterwards renewed. <span class="sidenote">Could only retard the
fall of Poland.</span>A patriot life like his may be said to
have tried the institutions of his country, and to have found
them wanting. After seventy-five years of anarchy, that dreaded
Partition, which had been mooted in his day<a id="FNanchor_149"
href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> but which he had
postponed for a hundred years, was at length carried into effect.
Austria, whom he had saved by his prowess, Prussia, whom he had
hoped to reunite to his country, Russia, whom his ancestor<a
id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
had laid at her feet—each took a share of the spoil. No other
patriot arose to save Poland from her rapid decline; and John
Sobieski may be called the last, as he was the greatest, of her
independent kings.</p>

The disparity is said to have been much greater, but it is

Most historians (and Salvandy in his first edition, 1827) follow
Coyer in giving the date 1629. Salvandy gives no reason for the
change in his later editions; but Sobieski must have been older
than fourteen when he travelled in France; and it appears that
his manuscript favours the earlier date. Coyer is most inaccurate
until the campaign of Podhaic, where his original authorities
begin, and is untrustworthy afterwards.</p>

the ground like a sack, and went away without a word. Shortly
afterwards he came back, and putting his head into the tent,
said, “John, they have paid me the money; God restore it thee!
Good-night!”</p>

60,000 men (two-thirds of them Cossacks), he started with large
hopes. “<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Me ad Turcarum regiam
[illos] ducturum.... Liberator Orientis rediturus vel pro Christi

his character in a most amiable light. “Whether I have merited
your indifference or not, come promptly to dissipate the cloud
which has covered our intimate friendship, and believe that your
presence will be more efficacious towards my speedy recovery than
all the art of my physicians.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_124" href="#FNanchor_124"
